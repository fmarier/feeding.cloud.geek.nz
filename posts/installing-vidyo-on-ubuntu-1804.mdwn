Following [these
instructions](http://information-technology.web.cern.ch/services/fe/howto/users-use-vidyo-linux)
as well as the comments in there, I was able to get
[Vidyo](https://www.vidyo.com/), the proprietary videoconferencing system
that Mozilla uses internally, to work on [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
18.04 (Bionic Beaver). The same instructions should work on recent versions
of [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) too.

# Installing dependencies

First of all, install all of the package dependencies:

    sudo apt install libqt4-designer libqt4-opengl libqt4-svg libqtgui4 libqtwebkit4 sni-qt overlay-scrollbar-gtk2 libcanberra-gtk-module

Then, ensure you have a [system tray application
running](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=989811#c3). This
should be the case for most desktop environments.

# Building a custom Vidyo package

Download [version 3.6.3](https://vidyoportal.cern.ch/upload/VidyoDesktopInstaller-ubuntu64-TAG_VD_3_6_3_017.deb)
from the [CERN Vidyo
Portal](https://vidyoportal.cern.ch/download.html?lang=en) but don't expect
to be able to install it right away.

You need to first hack the package in order to [remove obsolete
dependencies](https://support.vidyocloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/226103528-VidyoDesktop-3-6-3-for-Linux-and-Ubuntu-15-04-and-higher).

Once that's done, install the resulting package:

    sudo dpkg -i vidyodesktop-custom.deb

# Packaging fixes and configuration

There are a few more things to fix before it's ready to be used.

First, fix the ownership on the main executable:

    sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/VidyoDesktop

Then disable autostart since you don't probably don't want to keep the
client running all of the time (and listening on the network) given it
hasn't received any updates in a long time and has apparently been abandoned
by Vidyo:

    sudo rm /etc/xdg/autostart/VidyoDesktop.desktop

Remove any old configs in your home directory that could interfere with this
version:

    rm -rf ~/.vidyo ~/.config/Vidyo

Finally, launch `VidyoDesktop` and go into the settings to check "Always use
VidyoProxy".
