Here are some notes on how to securely delete computer data in a way that
makes it impractical for anybody to recover that data. This is an important
thing to do before giving away (or throwing away) old disks.

Ideally though, it's better not to have to rely on secure erasure and start
use full-disk encryption right from the start, for example, using
[LUKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup). That way if the secure deletion fails for whatever reason, or
can't be performed (e.g. the drive is dead), then it's not a big deal.

# Rotating hard drives

With ATA or SCSI hard drives, [DBAN](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dban/)
seems to be the ideal solution.

1. Burn it on CD,
2. boot with it,
3. and following the instructions.

Note that you should **disconnect any drives you don't want to erase**
before booting with that CD.

This is probably the most trustworth method of wiping since it uses free and
open source software to write to each sector of the drive several times. The
methods that follow rely on proprietary software built into the
firmware of the devices and so you have to trust that it is implemented
properly and not backdoored.

# ATA / SATA solid-state drives

Due to the nature of solid-state storage (i.e. the lifetime number of writes
is limited), it's not a good idea to use DBAN for those. Instead, we must
rely on the vendor's implementation of [ATA Secure
Erase](https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase).

First, set a password on the drive:

    hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass p /dev/sdX

and then issue a Secure Erase command:

    hdparm --user-master u --security-erase-enhanced p /dev/sdX

# NVMe solid-state drives

For SSDs using an NVMe connector, simply request a [User Data
Erase](https://www.mankier.com/1/nvme-format)

    nvme format -s1 /dev/nvme0n1
