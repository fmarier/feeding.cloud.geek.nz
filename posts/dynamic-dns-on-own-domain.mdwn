I recently moved my dynamic DNS hostnames from
[dyndns.org](https://dyn.com/dns/) (now owned by Oracle) to
[No-IP](https://www.noip.com/remote-access). In the process, I moved all of
my hostnames under a sub-domain that I control in case I ever want to
self-host the authoritative DNS server for it.

# Creating an account

In order to use my own existing domain, I registered for the [Plus Managed
DNS](https://www.noip.com/remote-access) service and provided my top-level
domain (`fmarier.org`).

Then I created a [support ticket](https://www.noip.com/ticket/) to ask for
the **sub-domain feature**. Without that, No-IP expects you to delegate your
entire domain to them, whereas I only wanted to delegate `*.dyn.fmarier.org`.

Once that got enabled, I was able to create hostnames like `machine.dyn` in
the No-IP control panel. Without the sub-domain feature, you can't have dots
in hostnames.

I used a bogus IP address (e.g. `1.2.3.4`) for all of the hostnames I
created in order to easily confirm that the client software is working.

# DNS setup

On my registrar's side, here are the DNS records I had to add to delegate
anything under `dyn.fmarier.org` to No-IP:

    dyn NS ns1.no-ip.com.
    dyn NS ns2.no-ip.com.
    dyn NS ns3.no-ip.com.
    dyn NS ns4.no-ip.com.
    dyn NS ns5.no-ip.com.

# Client setup

In order to update its IP address whenever it changes, I installed
[inadyn](https://github.com/troglobit/inadyn) on each of my
machines:

    apt install inadyn

I added the following to `/etc/inadyn.conf`:

    provider default@noip.com {
           username = johndoe
           password = Password1!
           hostname = machinename.dyn.fmarier.org
           checkip-server = fmarier.org
           checkip-path = /whats-my-ip.shtml?machinename
    }

and set the following in `/etc/default/inadyn`:

    RUN_DAEMON="yes"

before restarting the service:

    systemctl restart inadyn.service

Note that I am using [setup my own lightweight IP address echoing
service](/posts/displaying-ip-address-apache-server-side-includes/) to get
the external IP address, but using the default server seems to work fine
too. In that case, there's no need to set the `checkip-server` and
`checkip-path` variables.

Since I use [logcheck](https://packages.debian.org/stable/logcheck), I also
created a new `/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server/local-inadyn` file with the
following content:

    ^(\w{3} [ :[:digit:]]{11}|[0-9T:.+-]{32}) [._[:alnum:]-]+ inadyn\[[[:digit:]]+\]: Starting DynDNS client : inadyn.$
    ^(\w{3} [ :[:digit:]]{11}|[0-9T:.+-]{32}) [._[:alnum:]-]+ inadyn\[[[:digit:]]+\]: In-a-dyn version [0-9.]+ -- Dynamic DNS update client.$

# Testing

To test that the client software is working, wait 6 minutes (there is an
internal check which cancels any client invocations within 5 minutes of
another), then run it manually:

    inadyn --once --force --foreground --loglevel=debug

The IP for that machine should now be visible on the [No-IP control
panel](https://www.noip.com/members/dns/) and in DNS lookups:

    dig +short machinename.dyn.fmarier.org
