I recently moved my dynamic DNS hostnames from
[dyndns.org](https://dyn.com/dns/) (now owned by Oracle) to
[No-IP](https://www.noip.com/remote-access). In the process, I moved all of
my hostnames under a sub-domain that I control in case I ever want to
self-host the authoritative DNS server for it.

# Creating an account

In order to use my own existing domain, I registered for the [Plus Managed
DNS](https://www.noip.com/remote-access) service and provided my top-level
domain (`fmarier.org`).

Then I created a [support ticket](https://www.noip.com/ticket/) to ask for
the **sub-domain feature**. Without that, No-IP expects you to delegate your
entire domain to them, whereas I only wanted to delegate `*.dyn.fmarier.org`.

Once that got enabled, I was able to create hostnames like `machine.dyn` in
the No-IP control panel. Without the sub-domain feature, you can't have dots
in hostnames.

I used a bogus IP address (e.g. `1.2.3.4`) for all of the hostnames I
created in order to easily confirm that the client software is working.

# DNS setup

On my registrar's side, here are the DNS records I had to add to delegate
anything under `dyn.fmarier.org` to No-IP:

    dyn NS ns1.no-ip.com.
    dyn NS ns2.no-ip.com.
    dyn NS ns3.no-ip.com.
    dyn NS ns4.no-ip.com.
    dyn NS ns5.no-ip.com.

# Client setup

In order to update its IP address whenever it changes, I installed
[ddclient](https://sourceforge.net/p/ddclient/wiki/Home/) on each of my
machines:

    apt install ddclient

While the [ddclient package](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/ddclient)
[won't help you
configure](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=625715) your
No-IP service during installation or [enable the web IP lookup
method](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=285007), this can
all be done by editing the configuration after the fact.

I put the following in `/etc/ddclient.conf`:

    ssl=yes
    protocol=noip
    use=web, web=checkip.dyndns.com, web-skip='IP Address'
    server=dynupdate.no-ip.com
    login=myusername
    password='Password1!'
    machinename.dyn.fmarier.org

and the following in `/etc/default/ddclient`:

    run_dhclient="false"
    run_ipup="false"
    daemon_interval="3600"

Then restart the service:

    systemctl restart ddclient.service

Note that you do need to change the default update interval or the
`checkip.dyndns.com` server [will ban your IP
address](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=489997).

Alternatively, just [setup your own lightweight IP address echoing
service](/posts/displaying-ip-address-apache-server-side-includes/)
and avoid the problem entirely.

# Testing

To test that the client software is working, wait 6 minutes (there is an
internal check which cancels any client invocations within 5 minutes of
another), then run it manually:

    ddclient --verbose --debug

The IP for that machine should now be visible on the [No-IP control
panel](https://www.noip.com/members/dns/) and in DNS lookups:

    dig +short machinename.dyn.fmarier.org
