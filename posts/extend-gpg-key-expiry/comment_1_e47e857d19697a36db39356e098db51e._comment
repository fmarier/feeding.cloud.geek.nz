There's a quicker method if you just want to extend the expiration date:

    gpg --quick-set-expire KEYID PERIOD

â€¦and for the subkeys:

    gpg --quick-set-expire KEYID PERIOD '*'


PS: Did you know you could lint your PGP keys? The [hopenpgp-tools](https://salsa.debian.org/clint/hopenpgp-tools) include `hokey lint`.
