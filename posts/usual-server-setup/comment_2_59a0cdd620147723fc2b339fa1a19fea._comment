Great article to set-up a server and directly apply system hardening principles. Gave me some new ideas for open source security auditing tool Lynis, which you and your readers might find useful after setting up a server. If you are interested, Lynis can be downloaded via [[https://cisofy.com/lynis/]] or [[GitHub|https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis]].
