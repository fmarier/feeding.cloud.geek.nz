I didn't try a real RAID1 setup, but I suspect that I might lose some of the performance advantages of having an SSD if I/O is blocked on the rotating drive.

Also, from a power usage point of view, it would mean that the hard drive needs to be spinning all the time, as opposed to every couple of hours.
