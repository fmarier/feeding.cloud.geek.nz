I totally agree that a RAID1 would kill the speed of SSD. But then, your post title says RAID1... :-)

Now, I wanted to mention that if you know the name of your device, you can check whether it's a rotational (HDD) or not (SSD). Here is an example of how you get the flag:

alexis~$ cat /sys/block/sda/queue/rotational

The file is either a 0 (SSD) or a 1 (HDD). What you need is the \"sda\" part of the path. In a shell script, it can be difficult to grab that info. Although a function such as \"df .\" give you the info, it's not that practical.

Anyway, your solution is pretty much what I had in mind. Thank you.
