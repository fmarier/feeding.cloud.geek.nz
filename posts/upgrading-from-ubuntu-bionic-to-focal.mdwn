I recently upgraded from Ubuntu 18.04.5 (bionic) to 20.04.1 (focal) and it
was one of the roughest Ubuntu upgrades I've gone through in a while. Here
are the notes I took on avoiding or fixing the problems I ran into.

## Preparation

Before going through the upgrade, I disabled the configurations which I know
interfere with the process:

- Enable [etckeeper](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/etckeeper) *auto-commits before install* by putting the
  following in `/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf`:

        AVOID_COMMIT_BEFORE_INSTALL=0

- Remount `/tmp` as exectuable:

        mount -o remount,exec /tmp

Another step I should have taken but didn't, was to temporarily remove [safe-rm](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/safe-rm)
since it [caused some problems](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-release-upgrader/+bug/1893724) related to a Perl upgrade happening at the
same time:

    apt remove safe-rm

## Network problems (netplan.io)

After the upgrade, my network settings weren't really working properly and
so I started by switching from
[ifupdown](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ifupdown) to
[netplan.io](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/netplan.io) which seems to
be the preferred way of configuring the network on Ubuntu now.

Then I found out that netplan.io is
[incompatible](https://bugs.launchpad.net/netplan/+bug/1830507) with
[systemd-resolved's handling of `.local`
hostnames](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/459991/how-to-configure-systemd-resolved-for-mdns-multicast-dns-on-local-network/574006#574006).
I would be able to resolve a hostname using
[avahi](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/avahi):

    $ avahi-resolve --name machine.local
    machine.local	192.168.1.5

but not with systemd:

    $ systemd-resolve machine.local
    machine.local: resolve call failed: 'machine.local' not found

The best work-around I found was to [disable systemd-resolved](https://askubuntu.com/questions/907246/how-to-disable-systemd-resolved-in-ubuntu/907249#907249):

    systemctl stop systemd-resolved.service
    systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service
    rm /etc/resolv.conf

## Network problems (NetworkManager)

On a different machine, running NetworkManager instead of netplan.io,
I used a [different solution](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1279792/local-hostname-resolution-is-slow-on-20-04) which didn't involve disabling systemd-resolved.

Before making these changes, I could see that mdns was disabled in systemd-resolved:

    $ resolvectl mdns
    Global: no
    Link 2 (enp4s0): no

To fix it, I added the following in a new `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/mdns.conf` file:

    [connection]
    connection.mdns=2

which instructs NetworkManager to [register the hostname and resolve mDNS](https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/settings-connection.html)
on all network interfaces it manages.

Then I enabled mDNS globally in systemd-resolved by setting the following
in `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`:

    MulticastDNS=yes

before restarting both services:

    systemctl restart NetworkManager.service systemd-resolved.service

With that in place, `.local` hostnames are resolved properly and I can
see that mDNS is fully enabled:

    $ resolvectl mdns
    Global: yes
    Link 2 (enp4s0): yes

## Boot problems

For some reason I was able to boot with the kernel I got as part of the
focal update, but a later kernel update rendered my machine unbootable.

Adding some missing [RAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID)-related modules to
`/etc/initramfs-tools/modules`:

    raid1
    dmraid
    md-raid1

and then re-creating all initramfs:

    update-initramfs -u -k all

seemed to do the trick.

[[!tag ubuntu]] [[!tag systemd]] [[!tag raid]]
