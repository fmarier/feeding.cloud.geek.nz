Here are some notes I took around programming my [AnyTone AT-D878UV
radio](https://www.bridgecomsystems.com/collections/amateur-handheld-radios/products/anytone-at-d878uv-dual-band-dmr-handheld-radio-w-gps-programming-cable)
to operate on [DMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio)
using the [CPS
software](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/programming-anytone-d878uv-on-linux-using-windows10-and-virtualbox/)
that comes with it.

Note that you can always [tune in to a VFO channel by
hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHapE2wqSMI) if you haven't had time
to add it to your codeplug yet.

# DMR terminology

First of all, the [terminology of
DMR](https://www.jeffreykopcak.com/2017/05/10/dmr-in-amateur-radio-terminology/)
is quite different from that of the regular analog FM world.

Here are the basic terms:

- **Frequency**: *same meaning as in the analog world*
- **Repeater**: *same meaning as in the analog world*
- **Timeslot**: Each frequency is split into two timeslots (1 and 2) and what
  that means that there can be two simultaneous transmissions on each frequency.
- **Color code**: This is the digital equivalent of a CTCSS tone (sometimes
  called privacy tone) in that using the incorrect code means that you will
  tie up one of the timeslots on the frequency, but nobody else will hear
  you. These are [not actually named after
  colors](https://amateurradionotes.com/dmr.htm#colorcodes), but are instead
  just numerical IDs from 0 to 15.

There are two different identification mechanisms (both are required):

- **Callsign**: This is the same identifier issued to you by your country's
  amateur radio authority. Mine is [VA7GPL](https://www.qrz.com/lookup?tquery=VA7GPL&mode=callsign).
- **Radio ID**: This is a unique numerical ID tied to your callsign which
  you must [register for](https://radioid.net/register) ahead of time and
  program into your radio. Mine is
  [3027260](https://database.radioid.net/database/view?id=3027260#!).

The following is where this digital mode becomes most interesting:

- **Talkgroup**: a "chat room" where everything you say will be heard by
  anybody listening to that talkgroup
- **Network**: a group of repeaters connected together over the Internet
  (typically) and sharing a common list of talkgroups
- **Hotspot**: a personal simplex device which allows you to connect to a
  network with your handheld and access all of the talkgroups available on
  that network

The most [active](https://app.brandmeisteractivity.live/) network these days
is [Brandmeister](https://brandmeister.network/), but there are several others.

- **Access**: This can either be *Always on* which means that a talkgroup
  will be permanently broadcasting on a timeslot and frequency, or *PTT*
  which means a talkgroup will not be broadcast until it is first "woken up"
  by pressing the push-to-talk button and then will broadcast for a certain
  amount of time before going to sleep again.
- **Channel**: As in the analog world, this is what you select on your radio
  when you want to talk to a group of people. In the digital world however, it
  is tied not only to a frequency (and timeslot) and tone (color code), but
  also to a specific talkgroup.

Ultimately what you want to do when you program your radio is to find the
talkgroups you are interested in (from the list offered by your local
repeater) and then assign them to specific channel numbers on your radio.
More on that later.

# Callsign and Radio IDs

Before we get to talkgroups, let's set your callsign and [Radio
ID](https://radioid.net/database/search):

![](/posts/programming-dmr-radio-with-cps/radioid.png)

Then you need to download the latest list of Radio IDs so that your radio
can display people's names and callsigns instead of just their numerical IDs.

One approach is to only [download the list of users who recently
talked](https://brandmeister.network/?page=contactsexport) on talkgroups you
are interested in. For example, I used to download the contacts for the
following talkgroups:
```
91,93,95,913,937,3026,3027,302,30271,30272,530,5301,5302,5303,5304,3100,3153,31330
```
but these days, what I normally do is to just download the [entire worldwide
database](https://www.radioid.net/database/dumps) (`user.csv`) since my
radio still has enough storage (200k entries) for it.

In order for the `user.csv` file to work with the AnyTone CPS, it needs to
have particular columns and use the DOS end-of-line characters (`apt install
dos2unix` if you want to do it manually). I wrote a
[script](https://github.com/fmarier/user-scripts/blob/master/dmr-users) to
do all of the work for me.

If you use [dmrconfig](https://github.com/sergev/dmrconfig) to program this
radio instead, then the conversion is unnecessary. The `user.csv` file can
be used directly, however it will be truncated due to an [incorrect limit
hard-coded in the software](https://github.com/sergev/dmrconfig/issues/50).

# Talkgroups

Next, you need to pick the talkgroups you would like to allocate to specific
channels on your radio.

Start by looking at the documentation for your local repeaters (e.g.
[VE7RAG](http://www.bcfmca.bc.ca/dmr.php) and
[VE7NWR](http://www.nwarc.org/cms/?q=node/330) in the Vancouver area).

In addition to telling you the listen and transmit *frequencies* of the
repeater (again, this works the same way as with analog FM), these will tell
you which *talkgroups* are available and what *timeslots* and *color codes*
they have been set to. It will also tell you the type of *access* for each
of these talkgroups.

This is how I programmed a channel:

![](/posts/programming-dmr-radio-with-cps/ve7rag-bc2.png)

and a talkgroup on the VE7RAG repeater in my radio:

![](/posts/programming-dmr-radio-with-cps/tg-bc2.png)

If you don't have a local repeater with DMR capability, or if you want to
access talkgroups available on a different network, then you will need to
get a DMR hotspot such as one that's compatible with the
[Pi-Star](https://www.pistar.uk/) software.

This is an excerpt from the programming I created for the talkgroups
I made available through my hotspot:

![](/posts/programming-dmr-radio-with-cps/brandmeister-nz-national.png)
![](/posts/programming-dmr-radio-with-cps/tg-zl-national.png)

One of the unfortunate limitations of the CPS software for the AnyTone 878
is that talkgroup numbers are globally unique identifiers. This means that
if TG1234 (hypothetical example) is *Ragchew 3000* on DMR-MARC but
*Iceland-wide chat* on Brandmeister, then you can't have two copies of it
with different names. The solution I found for this was to give that
talkgroup the name "TG1234" instead of "Ragchew3k" or "Iceland". I use a
more memorable name for non-conflicting talkgroups, but for the problematic
ones, I simply repeat the talkgroup number.

# Simplex

Talkgroups are not required to operate on DMR. Just like analog FM, you can
talk to another person point-to-point using a simplex channel.

The convention for all simplex channels is the following:

- Talkgroup: `99`
- Color code: `1`
- Timeslot: `1`
- Admit criteria: `Always`
- In Call Criteria: `TX` or `Always`

![](/posts/programming-dmr-radio-with-cps/tg-simplex.png)

After talking to the [British Columbia Amateur Radio Coordination
Council](https://bcarcc.org/), I found that the following frequency ranges are
most suitable for DMR simplex:

- 145.710-145.790 MHz (simplex digital transmissions)
- 446.000-446.975 MHz (all simplex modes)

The [VECTOR
list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XNRLnQWY1AJiQQy1umiEBTf4oBMyhrjOc0CIhlLm4pI/edit#gid=0)
identifies two frequencies in particular:

- 446.075 MHz
- 446.500 MHz
