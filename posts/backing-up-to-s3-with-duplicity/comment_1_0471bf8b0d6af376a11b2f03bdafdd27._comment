What error do you get if you don't grant ListAllMyBuckets?

I've been running duplicity to S3 without that permission for years and never encountered an issue. Though I see lots of other web sites saying the same thing. I'm actually using the duply frontend to duplicity but I think it's unlikely that makes a difference.
