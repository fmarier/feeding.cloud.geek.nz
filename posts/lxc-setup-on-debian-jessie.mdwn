Here's how to setup LXC-based "chroots" on Debian jessie. While this is
documented on the [Debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/LXC), I had to tweak
a few things to get the networking to work on my machine.

Start by installing (as root) the necessary packages:

    apt-get install lxc libvirt-bin debootstrap

# Network setup

I decided to use the default `/etc/lxc/default.conf` configuration (no
change needed here):

    lxc.network.type = veth
    lxc.network.flags = up
    lxc.network.link = virbr0
    lxc.network.hwaddr = 00:FF:AA:xx:xx:xx
    lxc.network.ipv4 = 0.0.0.0/24

but I had to make sure that the "guests" could connect to the outside world
through the "host":

1. Enable IPv4 forwarding by putting this in `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

        net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

2. and then applying it using:

        sysctl -p

3. Ensure that the network bridge is automatically started on boot:

        virsh -c lxc:/// net-start default
        virsh -c lxc:/// net-autostart default

4. and that it's not blocked by the host firewall, by putting this in `/etc/network/iptables.up.rules`:

        -A INPUT -d 224.0.0.251 -s 192.168.122.1 -j ACCEPT
        -A INPUT -d 192.168.122.255 -s 192.168.122.1 -j ACCEPT
        -A INPUT -d 192.168.122.1 -s 192.168.122.0/24 -j ACCEPT

5. and applying the rules using:

        iptables-apply

# Creating a container

Creating a new container (in `/var/lib/lxc/`) is simple:

    sudo MIRROR=http://ftp.nz.debian.org/debian lxc-create -n sid64 -t debian -- -r sid -a amd64

You can start or stop it like this:

    sudo lxc-start -n sid64 -d
    sudo lxc-stop -n sid64

# Connecting to a guest using ssh

The ssh server is configured to require pubkey-based authentication for root
logins, so you'll need to log into the console:

    sudo lxc-stop -n sid64
    sudo lxc-start -n sid64

then install a text editor inside the container because the root image
doesn't have one by default:

    apt-get install vim

then paste your public key in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

Then you can exit the console (using `Ctrl+a q`) and ssh into the
container. You can find out what IP address the container received from DHCP
by typing this command:

    sudo lxc-ls --fancy

# Fixing Perl locale errors

If you see a bunch of errors like these when you start your container:

    perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
    perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
	LANGUAGE = (unset),
	LC_ALL = (unset),
	LANG = "fr_CA.utf8"
        are supported and installed on your system.
    perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").

then log into the container as root and use:

    dpkg-reconfigure locales

to enable the same locales as the ones you have configured in the host.
