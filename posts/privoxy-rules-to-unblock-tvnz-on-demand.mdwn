My default [Privoxy](http://www.privoxy.org/) (a great Privacy-enhancing/ad blocking proxy) setup was blocking the on-demand section of TVNZ.  
  
It was however quite easy to fix:  


    { -block }  
    tvnz.co.nz/stylesheets/tvnz/lib/js/  
    .2mdn.net/instream/


  
TV3 can also be [unblocked](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/2008/10/privoxy-rules-to-unblock-tv3-on-demand.html) in a similar way.
