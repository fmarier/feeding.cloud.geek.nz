Notice that Zoom WebRTC is not real WebRTC, they are using data channels
to integrate with proprietary WebAssembly client code:

<https://bloggeek.me/when-will-zoom-use-webrtc/>

Real WebRTC does not require WebAssembly or data channels.

Firefox only supports WebAssembly on x86 / amd64

That is why it is not working on Pi 4

Same problem on POWER9 and arm64 workstations.
