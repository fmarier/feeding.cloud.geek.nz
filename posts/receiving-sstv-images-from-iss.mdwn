Thanks to a fellow [VECTOR](https://vectorradio.ca) volunteer [Nick
Doyle](https://www.qrz.com/db/VE7NCD), I found out that the [International
Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station)
would be broadcasting [slow-scan
television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television) images at
the end of the year. I decided to try and pick those up with my handheld
radio.

# Planning

From the [official announcement](https://ariss.pzk.org.pl/sstv/), I got the
frequency (145.800 MHz) and the broadcast times.

Next I had to figure out when the ISS would be passing over my location.
Most of the ISS tracking websites and applications are aimed at people
wanting to _see_ the reflection of the sun on the station and so they only
list the passes during nighttime before the earth casts a shadow that would
prevent any visual contacts.

Thankfully, Nick found a site which has a option to show all of the passes,
visible or not and so I was able to get a [list of upcoming passes over
Vancouver](https://heavens-above.com/PassSummary.aspx?satid=25544&lat=49.2827&lng=-123.1207&loc=Vancouver&alt=0&tz=PST).

# Hardware

From a hardware point-of-view, I didn't have to get any special equipment. I
used my [Kenwood D72](https://www.kenwood.com/usa/com/amateur/th-d72a/) and
an external Comet SBB5 mobile antenna.

The only other pieces of equipment I used was a 2.5mm mono adapter which I
used to connect a 3.5mm male-male audio cable in the speaker port of the
radio and the microphone input of my computer.

# Software

The software I used for the recording was
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) set to a **sampling rate of 48
kHz**.

Then I installed
[qsstv](http://users.telenet.be/on4qz/qsstv/manual/index.html) and
configured it to [read input from a file instead of the sound
card](http://users.telenet.be/on4qz/qsstv/faq.html#Audiofile).

# Results

Here is the [audio I
recorded](/posts/receiving-sstv-images-from-iss/iss_sstv1.wav) from the
first pass (65 degrees at the highest point) as well as the rendered image:

The second pass (60 degrees) was not as successful since I didn't hold the
squelch open and you can tell from the [audio
recording](/posts/receiving-sstv-images-from-iss/iss_sstv2.wav) that the
signal got drowned in noise a couple of times. This is the rendering of that
second pass:

# Tips

The signal came through the squelch for only about a minute at the highest
point, so I found it best to open the squelch fully (`F`+`Moni`) as soon as
the bird is visible.

Another thing I did on a third pass (16 degrees at the highest point -- not
particularly visible) was to plug the speaker out of my radio into a Y
splitter so that I could connect it to my computer and an external speaker I
could take outside with me. Since I was able to listen to the audio, I held
the antenna and tried to **point it** at the [satellite's general
direction](https://heavens-above.com/orbit.aspx?satid=25544&lat=49.2827&lng=-123.1207&loc=Vancouver&alt=0&tz=PST)
as well as **varying the orientation** of the antenna to increase the signal
strength.
