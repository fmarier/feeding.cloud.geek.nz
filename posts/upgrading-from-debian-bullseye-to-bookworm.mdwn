Over the last few months, I upgraded my Debian machines from
[bullseye](https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/) to
[bookworm](https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/). The process was
uneventful (besides the [asterisk](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/asterisk)
issue described below), but I ended up reconfiguring several things afterwards in
order to modernize my upgraded machines.

# Logcheck

I noticed in this release that the transition to
[journald](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/Journal) is essentially
complete. This means that `rsyslog` is no longer needed on most of my systems:

    apt purge rsyslog

Once that was done, I was able to comment out the following lines in
`/etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles.d/syslog.logfiles`:

    #/var/log/syslog
    #/var/log/auth.log

I did have to adjust some of my custom logcheck rules, particularly the ones that
deal with kernel messages:

    --- a/logcheck/ignore.d.server/local-kernel
    +++ b/logcheck/ignore.d.server/local-kernel
    @@ -1,1 +1,1 @@
    -^\w{3} [ :[:digit:]]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ kernel: \[[0-9. ]+]\ IN=eno1 OUT= MAC=[0-9a-f:]+ SRC=[0-9a-f.:]+
    +^\w{3} [ :[:digit:]]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ kernel: (\[[0-9. ]+]\ )?IN=eno1 OUT= MAC=[0-9a-f:]+ SRC=[0-9a-f.:]+

Then I moved local entries from `/etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles` to `/etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles.d/local.logfiles`
(`/var/log/syslog` and `/var/log/auth.log` are enabled by default when
needed) and removed some files that are no longer used:

    rm /var/log/mail.err*
    rm /var/log/mail.warn*
    rm /var/log/mail.info*

Finally, I had to fix any unescaped `|` characters in my local rules. For example
`error == NULL || \*error == NULL` must now be written as `error == NULL \|\| \*error == NULL`.

# Networking

After the upgrade, I got a notice that the `isc-dhcp-client` is now
deprecated and so I removed if from my system:

    apt purge isc-dhcp-client

This however meant that I need to ensure that my network configuration
software does not depend on the now-deprecated DHCP client.

On my laptop, I was already using
[NetworkManager](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager) for my main
network interfaces and that has built-in DHCP support.

## Migration to systemd-networkd

On my backup server, I took this opportunity to switch from `ifupdown` to
[`systemd-networkd`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd-networkd) by
removing `ifupdown`:

    apt purge ifupdown
    rm /etc/network/interfaces

putting the following in `/etc/systemd/network/20-wired.network`:

    [Match]
    Name=eno1
    
    [Network]
    DHCP=yes
    MulticastDNS=yes

and then enabling/starting `systemd-networkd`:

    systemctl enable systemd-networkd
    systemctl start systemd-networkd

I also needed to install polkit:

    apt install --no-install-recommends policykit-1

in order to [allow `systemd-networkd` to set the hostname](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/16656).

In order to start my firewall automatically as interfaces are brought up, I
wrote a [dispatcher script to apply my existing `iptables`
rules](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/using-iptables-with-systemd-networkd/).

## Migration to predictacle network interface names

On my Linode server, I did the same as on the backup server, but I put the
following in `/etc/systemd/network/20-wired.network` since it has a static
IPv6 allocation:

    [Match]
    Name=enp0s4
    
    [Network]
    DHCP=yes
    Address=2600:3c01::xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:939f/64
    Gateway=fe80::1

and switched to predictable network interface names by deleting these two
files:

- `/etc/systemd/network/50-virtio-kernel-names.link`
- `/etc/systemd/network/99-default.link`

and then changing `eth0` to `enp0s4` in:

- `/etc/network/iptables.up.rules`
- `/etc/network/ip6tables.up.rules`
- `/etc/rc.local` (for [OpenVPN](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/creating-a-linode-based-vpn-setup-using_openvpn_on_debian_or_ubuntu/))
- `/etc/logcheck/ignored.d.*/*`

Then I regenerated all initramfs:

    update-initramfs -u -k all

and rebooted the virtual machine.

## Giving systemd-resolved control of `/etc/resolv.conf`

After reading [this history of DNS resolution on
Linux](https://tailscale.com/blog/sisyphean-dns-client-linux/), I decided to
modernize my `resolv.conf` setup and let `systemd-resolved` handle
`/etc/resolv.conf`.

I installed the package:

    apt install systemd-resolved

and then removed no-longer-needed packages:

    apt purge openresolv resolvconf avahi-daemon

I also disabled support for [Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-Local_Multicast_Name_Resolution) after reading [this person's reasoning](https://brokkr.net/2022/07/03/switching-to-systemd-resolved-for-mdns/) by putting the following in `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/llmnr.conf`:

    [Resolve]
    LLMNR=no

I verified that mDNS is enabled and LLMNR is disabled:

    $ resolvectl mdns
    Global: yes
    Link 2 (enp0s25): yes
    Link 3 (wlp3s0): yes
    $ resolvectl llmnr
    Global: no
    Link 2 (enp0s25): no
    Link 3 (wlp3s0): no

### Problems with auto-discovery of local printers

Note that if you want auto-discovery of local printers using CUPS, you need
to keep `avahi-daemon` since [`cups-browsed` doesn't support
`systemd-resolved`](https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5452). You can
verify that it works using:

    sudo lpinfo --include-schemes dnssd -v

### DNS resolution problems with ifupdown

Also, if you haven't migrated to `systemd-networkd` yet and are still using
`ifupdown` with a static IP address, you will likely run into [DNS
problems](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1031236) which
can be fixed using the following patch to `/etc/network/if-up.d/resolved`:

and make sure you have nameservers setup in your static config, for example
one of my servers' `/etc/network/interfaces` looks like this:

    iface enp4s0 inet static
         address 192.168.1.2
         netmask 255.255.255.0
         gateway 192.168.1.1

         dns-nameservers 149.112.122.20
         pre-up iptables-restore /etc/network/iptables.up.rules

## Dynamic DNS

I replaced [ddclient](https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/ddclient) with
[inadyn](https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/inadyn) since it [doesn't work
with no-ip.com
anymore](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1038431), using
the [configuration I described in an old blog
post](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/dynamic-dns-on-own-domain/#Client_setup).

# chkrootkit

I moved my customizations in `/etc/chkrootkit.conf` to
`/etc/chkrootkit/chkrootkit.conf` after seeing this message in my logs:

# Unwanted power management

I ran into a problem with one of my servers where it would [suspend](https://wiki.debian.org/Suspend)
itself after a certain amount of time. This was due to default GDM behaviour
it turns out and while I could [tell gdm not to sleep on inactivity](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/749863/55688),
I instead put the following in `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d/nosuspend.conf` to fully
disable systemd-based suspend or hibernate:

    [Sleep]
    AllowSuspend=no
    AllowHibernation=no
    AllowSuspendThenHibernate=no
    AllowHybridSleep=no

# Asterisk has been removed from Debian

The only major problem I ran into while upgrading to bookworm is that I discovered
that [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/) has been [removed from `stable` and `testing`](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1031046).
For some reason, this was not mentioned in the [release notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#noteworthy-obsolete-packages)
and I have not yet found a good solution.

If you upgrade to bookworm, be warned that the `bullseye` packages will remain
installed (and will work fine in my experience) unless you "clean them up" with
`apt purge '~o'` accidentally and then you'll have to fetch these old debs manually.
