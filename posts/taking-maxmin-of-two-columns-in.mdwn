As part of a database [view](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/sql-createview.html), I found myself wanting to get [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) to display values from one of two columns, whichever was the largest.  
  
My first attempt was:  
  

<pre>
SELECT id, <b>MAX</b>(column1, column2) FROM table1;
</pre>

  
which of course didn't work because `MAX()` is an [aggregate function](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/functions-aggregate.html) which only takes a single parameter.  
  
What I was looking for instead, is something that was introduced in [8.1](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/release-8-1.html#AEN109656):  
  

<pre>
SELECT id, <b>GREATEST</b>(column1, column2) FROM table1;
</pre>

  
where `GREATEST()` (and its opposite: `LEAST()`) is a [conditional expression](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/functions-conditional.html).
