While talking about how [Mahara](http://mahara.org/) uses [Gerrit and Gitorious for code reviews](/2011/04/code-reviews-with-gerrit-and-gitorious.html), I forgot to include details on how to [link bugs](http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.1.6/config-gerrit.html#commentlink) in the commit logs to our bug tracker ([Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara)).  
  

### Links to Launchpad in the Gerrit review UI

Turning the bug numbers in git commit messages to links was just a matter of adding this to our `etc/gerrit.config` file.  


    [commentlink "launchpad"]  
      match = "([Bb]ug\\s+#?)(\\d+)"  
      link = https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/+bug/$2


All mentions of a bug number like "(bug #1234)" or "bug 5678" in a commit message or Gerrit review will be converted into links to the appropriate page on Launchpad.  
  

### Updating Launchpad bugs after Gerrit merges

Linking the original bug reports in Launchpad to committed code (and its review in Gerrit) was a little more complicated. It makes use of the [hooks](http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.1.6/config-hooks.html) available in Gerrit.  
  
The first step was to create a [new Launchpad account](https://launchpad.net/+login) for these automated updates and to confirm the email address it will be sending emails from. In our case, the account is [MaharaBot](https://launchpad.net/~dev-mahara).  
  
Then, we wrote a [custom hook script](https://gitlab.com/mahara/mahara-scripts/blob/master/change-merged) (inspired by [one for JIRA](https://github.com/hobbs/jirret)) which we placed in `~/mahara_reviews/etc/gerrit.config`.  
  
For an example of what it sends to the bug tracker, see [bug 788457](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/+bug/788457).
