I use my personal server as a VPN endpoint for my laptop when I'm using untrusted networks and I
wanted to do the same on my Android 5 (Lollipop) phone.

It turns out that it's quite easy to do (doesn't require rooting your phone)
and that it works very well.

## Install OpenVPN

Once you have [installed and configured OpenVPN on the
server](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/creating-a-linode-based-vpn-setup-using_openvpn_on_debian_or_ubuntu/),
you need to install the OpenVPN app for Android (available both on
[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=de.blinkt.openvpn) and
[Google
Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn)).

From the `easy-rsa` directory you created while generating the server keys,
create a new keypair for your phone:

    ./build-key nexus6        # "nexus6" as Name, no password

and then copy the following files onto your phone:

* `ca.crt`
* `nexus6.crt`
* `nexus6.key`
* `ta.key`

## Create a new VPN config

If you configured your server as per my instructions, these are the settings
you'll need to use on your phone:

Basic:

- LZO Compression: `YES`
- Type: `Certificates`
- CA Certificate: `ca.crt`
- Client Certificate: `nexus6.crt`
- Client Certificate Key: `nexus6.key`

Server list:

- Server address: `hafnarfjordur.fmarier.org`
- Port: `1194`
- Protocol: `UDP`
- Custom Options: `NO`

Authentication/Encryption:

- Expect TLS server certificate: `YES`
- Certificate hostname check: `YES`
- Remote certificate subject: `server`
- Use TLS Authentication: `YES`
- TLS Auth File: `ta.key`
- TLS Direction: `1`
- Encryption cipher: `AES-256-CBC`
- Packet authentication: `SHA384` (**not** `SHA-384`)

Advanced:

- Persistent tun: `YES`

That's it. Everything else should work with the defaults.
