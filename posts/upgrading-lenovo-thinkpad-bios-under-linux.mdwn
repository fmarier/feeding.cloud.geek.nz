The [Lenovo support site](http://support.lenovo.com/) offers downloadable
BIOS updates that can be run either from Windows or from a bootable CD.

Here's how to convert the bootable CD ISO images under Linux in order to
update the BIOS from a USB stick.

## Checking the BIOS version

Before upgrading your BIOS, you may want to look up which version of the
BIOS you are currently running. To do this, install the
[dmidecode](http://packages.debian.org/jessie/dmidecode) package:

    apt-get install dmidecode

then run:

    dmidecode

or alternatively, look at the following file:

    cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/bios_version

## Updating the BIOS using a USB stick

To update [without using a bootable
CD](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/BIOS_update_without_optical_disk), install
the [genisoimage](http://packages.debian.org/jessie/genisoimage) package:

    apt-get install genisoimage

then use `geteltorito` to convert the ISO you got from Lenovo:

    geteltorito -o bios.img gluj19us.iso

Insert a USB stick you're willing to **erase entirely** and then copy the
image onto it (replacing `sdX` with the correct **device** name, not
partition name, for the USB stick):

    dd if=bios.img of=/dev/sdX

then restart and boot from the USB stick by pressing Enter, then F12 when
you see the Lenovo logo.
