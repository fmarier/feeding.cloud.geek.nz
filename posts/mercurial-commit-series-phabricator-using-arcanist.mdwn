[Phabricator](https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/) supports multi-commit
patch series, but it's not yet obvious how to do it using Mercurial. So this
the "hg" equivalent of [this blog post for git
users](https://smacleod.ca/posts/commit-series-with-phabricator/ ).

Note that other people have written [tools and
plugins](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/mozilla.dev.platform/o9f2S0vO47k/discussion)
to do the same thing and that [an official client is coming
soon](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/LhUq1EUvcfg/yLuTpAhvCAAJ).

# Initial setup

I'm going to assume that you've setup arcanist and gotten an account on the
[Mozilla Phabricator instance](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/).
If you haven't, follow this [video
introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=3e-eaeeIDXk) or the
[excellent
documentation](https://moz-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phabricator-user.html)
for it (Bryce also wrote additionnal [instructions for Windows
users](https://www.brycevandyk.com/setting-up-arcanist-for-mozilla-development-on-windows/)).

# Make a list of commits to submit

First of all, use `hg histedit` to make a list of the commits that are needed:

    pick ee4d9e9fcbad 477986 Bug 1461515 - Split tracking annotations from tracki...
    pick 5509b5db01a4 477987 Bug 1461515 - Fix and expand tracking annotation tes...
    pick e40312debf76 477988 Bug 1461515 - Make TP test fail if it uses the wrong...

# Create Phabricator revisions

Now, create a Phabricator *revision* for each commit (in order, from
earliest to latest):

    ~/devel/mozilla-unified (annotation-list-1461515)$ hg up ee4d9e9fcbad
    5 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
    (leaving bookmark annotation-list-1461515)

# Link all revisions together

In order to ensure that these commits depend on one another, click on that
last [`phabricator.services.mozilla.com`
link](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D2486), then click "Related
Revisions" then "Edit Parent Revisions" in the right-hand side bar and then
add the previous commit
([D2485](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D2485) in this example).

Then go to [that parent
revision](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D2485) and repeat the
same steps to set [D2484](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D2484) as
its parent.

# Amend one of the commits

As it turns out my first patch wasn't perfect and I needed to amend the
middle commit to fix some test failures that came up after [pushing to
Try](https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=5ec6dd24172c11d5fc498dfcc9e5a0287ade312e).
I ended up with the following commits (as viewed in `hg histedit`):

    pick ee4d9e9fcbad 477986 Bug 1461515 - Split tracking annotations from tracki...
    pick c24f4d9e75b9 477992 Bug 1461515 - Fix and expand tracking annotation tes...
    pick 1840f68978a7 477993 Bug 1461515 - Make TP test fail if it uses the wrong...

which highlights that the last two commits changed and that I would have two
revisions ([D2485](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D2485) and
[D2486](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D2486)) to update in
Phabricator.

However, since the only reason why the third patch has a different commit
hash is because its parent changed, theres's no need to upload it again to
Phabricator. [Lando](https://lando.services.mozilla.com/) doesn't care about
the parent **hash** and relies instead on the parent **revision ID**. It
essentially applies diffs one at a time.

The trick was to pass the `--update DXXXX` argument to `arc diff`:

    ~/devel/mozilla-unified (annotation-list-1461515)$ hg up c24f4d9e75b9
    2 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
    (leaving bookmark annotation-list-1461515)

    ~/devel/mozilla-unified (c24f4d9)$ arc diff --no-amend --update D2485

    Updated an existing Differential revision:
            Revision URI: https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D2485

    Included changes:

      M       netwerk/test/unit/test_trackingProtection_annotateChannels.js
      M       toolkit/components/antitracking/test/browser/browser_imageCache.js

      M       toolkit/components/url-classifier/tests/mochitest/trackingRequest.html

Note that changing the commit message will not automatically update the
revision details in Phabricator. This has to be done manually in the Web UI
if required.
