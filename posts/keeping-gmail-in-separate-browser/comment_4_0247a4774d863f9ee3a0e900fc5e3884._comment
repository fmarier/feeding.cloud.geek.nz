Fran√ßois: This option is available only when creating a new profile. No such a thing as "edit" for an existing profile.  
I guess I'll have to create a new profile, and then import the important stuff to it. Unless you can think of a better option.  
  
What about performance, should it be a concern when using DOK as the profile folder (read/write speed to/from DOK)?
