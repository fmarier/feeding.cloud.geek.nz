The swap partition can hold a lot of unencrypted confidential information and the fact that it persists after shutting down the computer can be a problem.  
  
Encrypting a swap partition however is slightly tricky if one wants to also support suspend-to-disk (also called hibernation). Here's a procedure that worked for me on both Debian Stretch and Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver):
  
1. Install the [cryptsetup package](https://packages.debian.org/stable/cryptsetup):

       apt install cryptsetup

2. Add this line to `/etc/crypttab`:

       sda2_crypt /dev/sda2 /dev/urandom cipher=aes-xts-plain64,size=256,swap,discard

3. Set the swap partition to be this in `/etc/fstab`:

       /dev/mapper/sda2_crypt none swap sw 0 0

You will of course want to replace `/dev/sda2` with the partition that currently holds your unencrypted swap.  

This is loosely based on a similar [procedure for Ubuntu 6.10](http://www.c3l.de/linux/howto-completly-encrypted-harddisk-including-suspend-to-encrypted-disk-with-ubuntu-6.10-edgy-eft.html), but I don't use suspend-to-disk and so I simplified the setup and use a random encryption key instead of a passphrase.
