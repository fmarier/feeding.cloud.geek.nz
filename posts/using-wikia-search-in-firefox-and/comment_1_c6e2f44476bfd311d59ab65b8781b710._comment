Hey, Francois  
  
thanks for pointing me to Wikia search (and for improving vimperator).  
  
What I don't like about them is the mandatory Javascript. As long as it's there, I won't use Wikia Search, although search engine alternatives are sorely needed.  
  
Sadly, there seems to be no feedback page to let them know. Do you know of any?  
  
Regards
