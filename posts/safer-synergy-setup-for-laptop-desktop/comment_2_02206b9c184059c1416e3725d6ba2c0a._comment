My password was never in a paste buffer.  
  
The problem I'm alluding to is that of starting to type my password into a regular password field on the synergy client (my laptop).  
  
Then the synergyc client crashes before I'm done typing the password and so the keyboard comes back to the desktop where the IRC window is the one with the focus.  
  
Because all of this happens within 1 second, I never noticed and quickly pressed Enter after finishing to type my password. That's why my password ended up in the wrong window.
