Recently I've discovered [healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io), which is a free (and also FOSS) service that can check whether your mail server can deliver email.

The way it works: you configure a cron script on your server to send email to `<uuid>@healtchecks.io`, and if that email doesn't arrive for a set period (say, 24 hours, if you want one daily check), healtchecks.io will drop you a notification.
