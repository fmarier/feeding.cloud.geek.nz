[Compiling the
Brave Browser](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki#build-brave)
(based on [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home)) on Linux can take a
really long time and so most developers use
[sccache](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/sccache-for-faster-builds)
to cache objects files and speed up future re-compilations.

Here's the cronjob I wrote to seed my local cache every work day to
pre-compile the latest builds:

    30 23 * * 0-4   francois  /usr/bin/chronic /home/francois/bin/seed-brave-browser-cache

and here are the contents of that script:

    #!/bin/bash
    set -e
    
    # Set the path and sccache environment variables correctly
    source ${HOME}/.bashrc-brave
    export LANG=en_CA.UTF-8
    
    cd ${HOME}/devel/brave-browser-cache
    
    echo "Environment:"
    echo "- HOME = ${HOME}"
    echo "- PATH = ${PATH}"
    echo "- PWD = ${PWD}"
    echo "- SHELL = ${SHELL}"
    echo "- BASH_ENV = ${BASH_ENV}"
    echo
    
    echo $(date)
    echo "=> Update repo"
    git pull
    npm install
    npm run init
    
    echo $(date)
    echo "=> Delete any old build output"
    rm -rf src/out
    
    echo $(date)
    echo "=> Debug build"
    ionice nice timeout 4h npm run build
    echo
    
    echo $(date)
    echo "=>Release build"
    ionice nice timeout 5h npm run build Release
    echo
    
    echo $(date)
    echo "=> Delete build output"
    rm -rf src/out
