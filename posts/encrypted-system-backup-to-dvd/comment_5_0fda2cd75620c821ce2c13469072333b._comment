I have burned the key to the same media. It's possibly not as secure as having it on two separate discs since the passphrase could be brute-forced. But since the primary purpose of making a backup is to be able to restore stuff, I do want to be able to get to both pieces quickly if I need to.  
  
Have you got a different (more secure?) strategy that works for you?
