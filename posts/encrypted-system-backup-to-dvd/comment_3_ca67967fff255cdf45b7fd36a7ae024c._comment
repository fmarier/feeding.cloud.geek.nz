If it is for long term storage (eg more than a couple of weeks) I wouldn't encrypt it. When the time comes you'll have forgotten the password and/or the technology won't work the same.   
I encrypt a backup which gets written over frequently (so there is continuity of password/technology), but anything written to a DVD I wouldn't.
