Is the content of the page required for screen readers or something similar? Interesting that the setting to turn off automatic redirects is in the accessibility section.  
  
I would be a little worried that I had broken something else by removing the content that some software may be expecting.  
  
I may be totally wrong and it's just left over from a time when browsers did not support that header.
