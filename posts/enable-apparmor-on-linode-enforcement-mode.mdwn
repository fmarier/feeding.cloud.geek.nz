Enabling AppArmor on a Debian Linode VPS is not entirely straightforward.
Here's what I had to do in order to make it work.

# Packages to install

The easy bit was to install a few packages:

    apt install grub2 apparmor-profiles-extra apparmor-profiles apparmor

and then adding `apparmor=1 security=apparmor` to the kernel command line
(`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`) in `/etc/default/grub`.

# Move away from using Linode's kernels

As mentioned in [this blog
post](https://isawan.net/posts/apparmor-debian-linode), I found out that
these parameters are ignored by the Linode kernels.

I had to:

1. login to the Linode Manager (i.e.
   `https://cloud.linode.com/linodes/<linode ID>/configurations`),
2. click the node relevant node,
3. click "Edit" next to the _configuration profile_, and
4. change the kernel to "GRUB 2".

# Fix grub

Next I found out that grub doesn't actually install itself properly because
it can't be installed directly on the virtual drives provided by Linode
(KVM). Manually running this
[hack](https://www.linode.com/community/questions/10319/grub2-menu-missing#answer-49455)
worked for me:

    grub-install --grub-setup=/bin/true /dev/null

# Unbound + Let's Encrypt fix

Finally, my [local Unbound
installation](/posts/setting-up-your-own-dnssec-aware/) stopped
working because it couldn't access the Let's Encrypt certificates anymore.

The [solution](https://serverfault.com/a/1011037/93738) to this was pretty
straightforward. All I needed to do was to add the following to
`/etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.unbound`:

    /etc/letsencrypt/archive/** r,
    /etc/letsencrypt/live/** r,

[[!tag linode]] [[!tag apparmor]] [[!tag letsencrypt]] [[!tag unbound]]
[[!tag debian]] [[!tag grub]]
