The iTunes store is a good source of high-quality album cover art. If you
search for the album on [Google Images](https://images.google.com), then
visit the page and right-click on the cover image, you will get a **170 px
by 170 px** image. Change the `170x170` in the URL to one of the following
values to get a higher resolution image:

- `170x170`
- `340x340`
- `600x600`
- `1200x1200`
- `1400x1400`

Alternatively, use this [handy webapp](https://bendodson.com/code/itunes-artwork-finder/index.html) to
query the iTunes search API and get to the source image directly.
