Hi,
the way you do seems interesting. Till some time ago I was used to use akregator, but now I've change to rss2email [0]. What I do is running through cron the program rss2email which fetchs the feeds and sends them to my email inbox. There I order, sort and in case blacklist the feeds using the mailbox filters.

The advantage is that I can access them from wherever I am (through IMAP as well as webmail access), the filtering are really powerful and easy to set, it's in sync on every computer that I use.
