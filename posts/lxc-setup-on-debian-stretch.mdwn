Here's how to setup LXC-based "chroots" on Debian stretch. While I [wrote about this on Debian jessie](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/lxc-setup-on-debian-jessie/), I
had to make some [networking changes for stretch](https://wiki.debian.org/LXC#Networked_quickstart_for_Debian_Stretch_.28testing_as_of_Q3_2016.29)
and so here are the full steps that should work on stretch.

Start by installing (as root) the necessary packages:

    apt install lxc libvirt-clients debootstrap

# Network setup

I decided to use the default `/etc/lxc/default.conf` configuration (no
change needed here):

    lxc.network.type = veth
    lxc.network.link = lxcbr0
    lxc.network.flags = up
    lxc.network.hwaddr = 00:FF:AA:xx:xx:xx

That configuration requires that the `veth` kernel module be loaded. If
you have any kinds of module-loading restrictions enabled, you probably
need to add the following to `/etc/modules` and **reboot**:

    veth

Next, I had to make sure that the "guests" could connect to the outside
world through the "host":

1. Enable IPv4 forwarding by putting this in `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

       net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

2. and then applying it using:

       sysctl -p

3. Restart the network bridge:

       systemctl restart lxc-net.service

4. and ensure that it's not blocked by the host firewall, by putting this in `/etc/network/iptables.up.rules`:

       -A FORWARD -d 10.0.3.0/24 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
       -A FORWARD -s 10.0.3.0/24 -j ACCEPT
       -A INPUT -d 224.0.0.251 -s 10.0.3.1 -j ACCEPT
       -A INPUT -d 10.0.3.255 -s 10.0.3.1 -j ACCEPT
       -A INPUT -d 10.0.3.1 -s 10.0.3.0/24 -j ACCEPT

5. and applying the rules using:

       iptables-apply

# Creating a container

Creating a new container (in `/var/lib/lxc/`) is simple:

    sudo MIRROR=http://httpredir.debian.org/debian lxc-create -n sid64 -t debian -- -r sid -a amd64

You can start or stop it like this:

    sudo lxc-start -n sid64
    sudo lxc-stop -n sid64

# Connecting to a guest using ssh

The ssh server is configured to require pubkey-based authentication for root
logins, so you'll need to log into the console:

    sudo lxc-stop -n sid64
    sudo lxc-start -n sid64 -F

Since the root password is randomly generated, you'll need to reset it before
you can login as root:

    sudo lxc-attach -n sid64 passwd

Then login as root and install a text editor inside the container because the
root image doesn't have one by default:

    apt install vim

then paste your public key in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

Then you can exit the console (using `Ctrl+a q`) and ssh into the
container. You can find out what IP address the container received from DHCP
by typing this command:

    sudo lxc-ls --fancy

# Mounting your home directory inside a container

In order to have my home directory available within the container, I
created a user account for myself inside the container and then added
the following to the container config file (`/var/lib/lxc/sid64/config`):

    lxc.mount.entry=/home/francois /var/lib/lxc/sid64/rootfs/home/francois none bind 0 0

before restarting the container:

    lxc-stop -n sid64
    lxc-start -n sid64

# Fixing locale errors

If you see a bunch of errors like these when you start your container:

    perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
    perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
	LANGUAGE = (unset),
	LC_ALL = (unset),
	LANG = "fr_CA.utf8"
        are supported and installed on your system.
    perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").

then log into the container as root and use:

    dpkg-reconfigure locales

to enable the same locales as the ones you have configured in the host.

If you see these errors while reconfiguring the `locales` package:

    Generating locales (this might take a while)...
      en_US.UTF-8...cannot change mode of new locale archive: No such file or directory
     done
      fr_CA.UTF-8...cannot change mode of new locale archive: No such file or directory
     done
    Generation complete.

and see the following `dmesg` output on the host:

    [235350.947808] audit: type=1400 audit(1441664940.224:225): apparmor="DENIED" operation="chmod" info="Failed name lookup - deleted entry" error=-2 profile="/usr/bin/lxc-start" name="/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive.WVNevc" pid=21651 comm="localedef" requested_mask="w" denied_mask="w" fsuid=0 ouid=0

then AppArmor is interfering with the `locale-gen` binary and the
work-around I found is to temporarily shutdown AppArmor on the host:

    lxc-stop -n sid64
    systemctl stop apparmor
    lxc-start -n sid64

and then start up it later once the locales have been updated:

    lxc-stop -n sid64
    systemctl start apparmor
    lxc-start -n sid64

# AppArmor support

If you are running AppArmor, your container probably won't start until you
add the following to the container config (`/var/lib/lxc/sid64/config`):

    lxc.aa_allow_incomplete = 1
