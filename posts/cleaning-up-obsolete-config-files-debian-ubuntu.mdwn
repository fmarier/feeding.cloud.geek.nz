As part of regular operating system hygiene, I run a [cron
job](https://github.com/fmarier/root-scripts/blob/master/apt-cron) which
updates package metadata and looks for obsolete packages and configuration
files.

While there is already some easily available information on how to [purge
unneeded or obsolete
packages](https://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/01/31/debian-cleanup-tip-1-get-rid-of-useless-configuration-files/)
and how to [clean up config files properly in maintainer scripts](https://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/10/07/the-right-way-to-remove-an-obsolete-conffile-in-a-debian-package/
), the guidance on [how to delete obsolete config
files](http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.devel.mentors/61287) is not
easy to find and somewhat incomplete.

These are the obsolete conffiles I started with:

    $ dpkg-query -W -f='${Conffiles}\n' | grep 'obsolete$'
     /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/evince ae2a1e8cf5a7577239e89435a6ceb469 obsolete
     /etc/apparmor.d/tunables/ntpd 5519e4c01535818cb26f2ef9e527f191 obsolete
     /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.evince 08a12a7e468e1a70a86555e0070a7167 obsolete
     /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.ntpd a00aa055d1a5feff414bacc89b8c9f6e obsolete
     /etc/bash_completion.d/initramfs-tools 7eeb7184772f3658e7cf446945c096b1 obsolete
     /etc/bash_completion.d/insserv 32975fe14795d6fce1408d5fd22747fd obsolete
     /etc/dbus-1/system.d/com.redhat.NewPrinterNotification.conf 8df3896101328880517f530c11fff877 obsolete
     /etc/dbus-1/system.d/com.redhat.PrinterDriversInstaller.conf d81013f5bfeece9858706aed938e16bb obsolete


To get rid of the `/etc/bash_completion.d/` files, I first determined what
packages they were registered to:

    $ dpkg -S /etc/bash_completion.d/initramfs-tools
    initramfs-tools: /etc/bash_completion.d/initramfs-tools
    $ dpkg -S /etc/bash_completion.d/insserv
    initramfs-tools: /etc/bash_completion.d/insserv

and then did the following based on [Paul Wise's instructions](https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2013/05/msg00115.html)
and [this StackExchange answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/277197/55688):

    $ rm /etc/bash_completion.d/initramfs-tools /etc/bash_completion.d/insserv
    $ apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confmiss" install --reinstall initramfs-tools insserv

For some reason that didn't work for the `/etc/dbus-1/system.d/` files
and I had to purge and reinstall the relevant package:

    $ dpkg -S /etc/dbus-1/system.d/com.redhat.NewPrinterNotification.conf
    system-config-printer-common: /etc/dbus-1/system.d/com.redhat.NewPrinterNotification.conf
    $ dpkg -S /etc/dbus-1/system.d/com.redhat.PrinterDriversInstaller.conf
    system-config-printer-common: /etc/dbus-1/system.d/com.redhat.PrinterDriversInstaller.conf
    
    $ apt purge system-config-printer-common
    $ apt install system-config-printer

The files in `/etc/apparmor.d/` were even more complicated to deal with
because purging the packages that they come from didn't help:

    $ dpkg -S /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/evince
    evince: /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/evince
    $ apt purge evince
    $ dpkg-query -W -f='${Conffiles}\n' | grep 'obsolete$'
     /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/evince ae2a1e8cf5a7577239e89435a6ceb469 obsolete
     /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.evince 08a12a7e468e1a70a86555e0070a7167 obsolete

I was however able to get rid of them by also purging the apparmor profile
packages that are installed on my machine:

    $ apt purge apparmor-profiles apparmor-profiles-extra evince ntp
    $ apt install apparmor-profiles apparmor-profiles-extra evince ntp

Not sure why I had to do this but I suspect that these files used to be
shipped by one of the apparmor packages and then eventually migrated to the
`evince` and `ntp` packages directly and dpkg got confused.

If you're in a similar circumstance, you want want to search for the file you're
trying to get rid of on Google and then you might end up on <http://apt-browse.org/>
which could lead you to the old package that used to own this file.
