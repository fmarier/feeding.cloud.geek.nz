I have tried this patch in both versions of Ubuntu server 16.04 (32 and 64 bit) in a Virtual Box vm. I found that the 64 bit editions it's fine, but the 32 bit edition does not boot up. It stops with the message \"cryptsetup: lvm is not available\" Perhaps there is a way to solve this, but is far from my knowledge. Thanks for the patch.

Kind regards
