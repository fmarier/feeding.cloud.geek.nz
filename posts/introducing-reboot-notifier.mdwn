One of the packages that got
[lost](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=755443) in the
transition from Debian wheezy to jessie was the
[update-notifier-common](https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/update-notifier-common)
package which could be [used to receive notifications when a reboot is
needed](/posts/usual-server-setup/#Package_updates)
(for example, after installing a kernel update).

I decided to wrap this piece of functionality along with a [simple cron
job](https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/reboot-notifier.git/tree/debian/cron.daily)
and create a new package:
[reboot-notifier](https://packages.debian.org/sid/reboot-notifier).

Because it uses the same file (`/var/run/reboot-required`) to indicate
that a reboot is needed, it should work fine with any custom scripts that
admins might have written prior to jessie.

If you're running sid or strech, all you need to do is:

    apt install reboot-notifier

On jessie, you'll need to [add the backports
repository](http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/#index2h2) to
`/etc/apt/sources.list`:

    deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main
