Thank you so much for sharing your findings about the swapped pigtail cables in your Turris Omnia. I bought a TO just recently and set it up tonight. I noticed that I got signal levels of just -79 dBm in 2.4 GHz even when I was just 1 m away from the device. At the same time & place, I received 5 GHz signal with about -34 dBm.

Without your post and detailed description it would probably have taken me days to find out whats going on...
