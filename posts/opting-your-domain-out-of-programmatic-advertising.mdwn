A few years ago, the advertising industry introduced the [`ads.txt`
project](https://iabtechlab.com/ads-txt-about) in order to defend against
widespread *domain spoofing* vulnerabilities in [programmatic
advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmatic_advertising).

I decided to use this technology to opt out of having ads sold for my
domains, at least through ad exchanges which perform this check, by hosting
a text file containing this:

    contact=ads@fmarier.org

at the following locations:

- <https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/ads.txt>
- <https://fmarier.org/ads.txt>

(In order to get this to work on my blog, running
[Ikiwiki](https://ikiwiki.info/) on
[Branchable](https://www.branchable.com/), I had to disable the [txt
plugin](https://ikiwiki.info/plugins/txt/) in order to get `ads.txt` to be
served as a plain text file instead of being automatically rendered as
HTML.)

## Specification

The key parts of the [specification](https://iabtechlab.com/ads-txt/) for our purposes are:

> [3.1] If the server response indicates the resource does not exist (HTTP
Status Code 404), the advertising system can assume no declarations exist
and that no advertising system is unauthorized to buy and sell ads on the
website.

> [3.2.1] Some publishers may choose to not authorize any advertising system
by publishing an empty ads.txt file, indicating that no advertising system
is authorized to buy and sell ads on the website. So that consuming systems
properly read and interpret the empty file (differentiating between web
servers returning error pages for the /ads.txt URL), at least one properly
formatted line must be included which adheres to the format specification
described above.

As you can see, the specification sadly ignores
[RFC8615](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615) and requires that the
`ads.txt` file be present directly in the root of your web server, like the
venerable [`robots.txt`](http://www.robotstxt.org/) file, but unlike the
newer [`security.txt`](https://securitytxt.org/) standard.

If you don't want to provide an email address in your `ads.txt` file, the
specification recommends using the following line verbatim:

    placeholder.example.com, placeholder, DIRECT, placeholder

## Validation

A number of online validators exist, but I used the following to
double-check my setup:

- <https://adstxt.guru/validator/url/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffeeding.cloud.geek.nz%2Fads.txt>
- <https://www.adstxtgenerator.com/validator/results/?site=feeding.cloud.geek.nz>
