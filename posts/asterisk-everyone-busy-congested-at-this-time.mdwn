I was trying to figure out why I was getting a BUSY signal from
[Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/) while trying to ring a SIP phone even
though that phone was not in use.

My asterisk setup looks like this:

    phone 1 <--SIP--> asterisk 1 <==IAX2==> asterisk 2 <--SIP--> phone 2

While I couldn't call SIP phone #2 from SIP phone #1, the reverse was
working fine (ringing #1 from #2). So it's not a network/firewall problem.
The two SIP phones can talk to one another through their respective Asterisk
servers.

This is the error message I could see on the second asterisk server:

    $ asterisk -r
    ...
      == Using SIP RTP TOS bits 184
      == Using SIP RTP CoS mark 5
        -- Called SIP/12345
        -- SIP/12345-00000002 redirecting info has changed, passing it to IAX2/iaxuser-6347
        -- SIP/12345-00000002 is busy
      == Everyone is busy/congested at this time (1:1/0/0)
        -- Executing [12345@local:2] Goto("IAX2/iaxuser-6347", "in12345-BUSY,1") in new stack
        -- Goto (local,in12345-BUSY,1)
        -- Executing [in12345-BUSY@local:1] Hangup("IAX2/iaxuser-6347", "17") in new stack
      == Spawn extension (local, in12345-BUSY, 1) exited non-zero on 'IAX2/iaxuser-6347'
        -- Hungup 'IAX2/iaxuser-6347'

where:

- `12345` is the extension of SIP phone #2 on Asterisk server #2
- `iaxuser` is the user account on server #2 that server #1 uses
- `local` is the *context* that for incoming IAX calls on server #1

This `Everyone is busy/congested at this time (1:1/0/0)` was surprising
since looking at each SIP channel on that server showed nobody as busy:

    asterisk2*CLI> sip show inuse
    * Peer name               In use          Limit           
    12345                     0/0/0           2               

So I enabled the raw SIP debug output and got the following (edited for
clarity):

    asterisk2*CLI> sip set debug on
    SIP Debugging enabled

where:

- `12345` is the extension of SIP phone #2 on Asterisk server #2
- `67890` is the extension of SIP phone #1 on Asterisk server #2
- `192.168.0.4` is the IP address of SIP phone #2
- `192.168.0.1` is the IP address of Asterisk server #2

From there, I can see that SIP phone #2 is returning a status of `408 Do Not
Disturb`. That's what the problem was: **the phone itself was in DnD mode
and set to reject all incoming calls**.
