I had some problems getting the [Gandi certbot
plugin](https://github.com/obynio/certbot-plugin-gandi) to work in [Debian bullseye](https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/)
since the [documentation](https://sources.debian.org/src/python-certbot-dns-gandi/1.2.5-3/README.md/) appears to be outdated.

When running `certbot renew --dry-run`, I saw the following error message:

> Plugin legacy name certbot-plugin-gandi:dns may be removed in a future version. Please use dns instead.

Thanks to an [issue in another DNS
plugin](https://github.com/ctrlaltcoop/certbot-dns-hetzner/issues/8), I was
able to easily update my configuration to the new naming convention.

## Setup

Get an [API key from Gandi](https://api.gandi.net/docs/authentication/) and
then put it in `/etc/letsencrypt/gandi.ini`:

    # live dns v5 api key
    dns_api_key=ABCDEF

before make it only readable by `root`:

    chown root:root /etc/letsencrypt/gandi.ini
    chmod 600 /etc/letsencrypt/gandi.ini

Then install the [required package](https://packages.debian.org/stable/python3-certbot-dns-gandi):

    apt install python3-certbot-dns-gandi

## Getting an initial certificate

To get an initial certificate using the Gandi plugin, simply use the
following command:

    certbot certonly -a dns --dns-credentials /etc/letsencrypt/gandi.ini -d example.fmarier.org

## Setting up automatic renewal

If you have [automatic renewals enabled](posts/automatically-renewing-letsencrypt-certs-on-debian-using-certbot/),
you'll want to ensure your `/etc/letsencrypt/renewal/example.fmarier.org.conf`
file looks like this:

    # renew_before_expiry = 30 days
    version = 1.12.0
    archive_dir = /etc/letsencrypt/archive/example.fmarier.org
    cert = /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.fmarier.org/cert.pem
    privkey = /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.fmarier.org/privkey.pem
    chain = /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.fmarier.org/chain.pem
    fullchain = /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.fmarier.org/fullchain.pem
    
    [renewalparams]
    account = abcdef
    authenticator = dns
    server = https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    dns_credentials = /etc/letsencrypt/gandi.ini
