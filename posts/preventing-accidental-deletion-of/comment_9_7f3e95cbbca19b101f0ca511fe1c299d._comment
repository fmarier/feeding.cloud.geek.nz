lethalman: I'm not sure exactly what you mean by suggesting that this package be uploaded to mentors.debian.org because it's in unstable already and it's part of the collab-maint project.  
  
So if you want to contribute anything, feel free to clone the git repo at http://git.debian.org/?p=collab-maint/safe-rm.git and send patches.
