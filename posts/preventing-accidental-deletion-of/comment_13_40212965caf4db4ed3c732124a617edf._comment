I know it's non-standard but I tend to type:  
  
rm /usr/lib/blah -rf  
  
By putting the -rf at the end I ensure that I can't accidentally enter the command before I've typed the full path. I've also picked up the habit of always pausing before typing the final -rf to check that it is what I plan to do.
