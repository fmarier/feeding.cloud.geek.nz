In order to get closer to my goal of reducing my dependence on centralized
services, I decided to setup my own XMPP / Jabber server on a server
running [Debian buster](http://www.debian.org/releases/buster/). I chose
[ejabberd](http://www.ejabberd.im/) since it was recommended by the
[RTC Quick Start](http://www.rtcquickstart.org/) website and here's how I
put everything together.

# DNS and SSL

My personal domain is `fmarier.org` and so I created the following DNS
records:

    jabber-gw            CNAME    fmarier.org.
    _xmpp-client._tcp    SRV      5 0 5222 jabber-gw.fmarier.org.
    _xmpp-server._tcp    SRV 	  5 0 5269 jabber-gw.fmarier.org.

Then I went to get a free TLS certificate for the above.

## Let's Encrypt

The easiest way to get a certificate is to install [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/):

    apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache

Then, shutdown your existing webserver if you have one running and request
a cert like this:

    certbot --duplicate certonly --apache -d jabber-gw.fmarier.org -d fmarier.org

Once you have the cert, you can merge the private and public keys
into the file that ejabberd expects:

    cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/jabber-gw.fmarier.org/privkey.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/jabber-gw.fmarier.org/fullchain.pem > ejabberd.pem

and then restart the service:

    systemctl restart ejabberd.service

I wrote a [cronjob to renew this certificate automatically using certbot](/posts/automatically-renewing-letsencrypt-certs-on-debian-using-certbot/).

# ejabberd installation

Installing ejabberd on Debian is pretty simple and I mostly followed the
[steps on the Ubuntu wiki](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpJabberServer)
with an
[additional customization](http://www.die-welt.net/2013/05/wheezy-ejabberd-pidgin-and-srv-records/)
to solve the [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im) "Not authorized" connection problems.

1. Install the [package](http://packages.debian.org/stable/ejabberd), using
"admin" as the username for the administrative user:

      apt install ejabberd erlang-p1-sqlite3

2. Set the following in `/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.yml`:

       acl:
         admin:
            user:
                - "admin@fmarier.org"
       
       hosts:
         - "fmarier.org"
       
       auth_password_format: scram
       auth_scram_hash: sha512
       fqdn: "jabber-gw.fmarier.org"
       listen:
         -
           port: 3478
           ip: "::"
           transport: udp
           module: ejabberd_stun
           use_turn: false

2. Improve the reliability of the message archive management (MAM) by
changing adding these settings to `/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.yml`:

      sql_type: sqlite
      sql_database: "/var/lib/ejabberd/ejabberd.db"
      
      modules:
        mod_mam:
          db_type: sql
          compress_xml: true

3. Copy the SSL certificate into the `/etc/ejabberd/` directory and set the
permissions correctly:

      chown root:ejabberd /etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.pem
      chmod 640 /etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.pem

4. Improve the client-to-server and server-to-server TLS configuration:

       define_macro:
         # ...
         'DH_FILE': "/etc/ejabberd/dhparams.pem"
       
       c2s_dhfile: 'DH_FILE'
       s2s_dhfile: 'DH_FILE'
       
       listen:
         -
           port: 5222
           ip: "::"
           module: ejabberd_c2s
           starttls_required: true
      
       s2s_use_starttls: required

5. Create the required `dhparams.pem` file:

       openssl dhparam -out /etc/ejabberd/dhparams.pem 2048

6. Optionally disable non-essential modules by commenting them out under the `modules:` section of `/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.yml`:

       ## mod_avatar
       ## mod_muc

6. Restart the ejabberd daemon:

       systemctl restart ejabberd.service

7. Create a new user account for yourself:

       ejabberdctl register me fmarier.org P@ssw0rd1!

8. Open up the following ports on the server's firewall:

       iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 3478 -j ACCEPT
       iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5222 -j ACCEPT
       iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5269 -j ACCEPT

9. Optionally create a cronjob in `/etc/cron.d/restart-ejabberd`
to restart ejabberd once a day to ensure it doesn't stop responding
to requests after running for a while:

      0 4 * * *      root    /bin/systemctl restart ejabberd.service

Note that if you'd like to be able to talk to contacts via the GMail XMPP
server, you will unfortunately need to change the `s2s_use_starttls`
setting in step 4 to the following:

      s2s_use_starttls: optional

# Client setup

On the client side, if you use Pidgin, create a new account with the
following settings in the "Basic" tab:

* Protocol: XMPP
* Username: `me`
* Domain: `fmarier.org`
* Password: `P@ssw0rd1!`

and the following setting in the "Advanced" tab:

* Connection security: Require encryption

From this, I was able to connect to the server without clicking through any
certificate warnings.

# Testing

If you want to make sure that XMPP federation works, add your GMail address
as a buddy to the account and send yourself a test message.

In this example, the XMPP address I give to my friends is `me@fmarier.org`.

Finally, to ensure that your TLS settings are reasonable, use this
[automated tool](https://xmpp.net/) to test both the client-to-server (c2s)
and the server-to-server (s2s) flows.

# Spam protection

If you start having problems with spammers sending messages or subscription
requests to your users, you can whitelist the servers that are allowed to
federate with yours by putting the following in
`/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.yml`:

    acl:
      trusted_servers:
        server:
          - "cheogram.com"
          - "conference.soprani.ca"
          - "jmp.chat"

    access:
      s2s:
        allow: trusted_servers
        deny: all
    
    s2s_access: s2s

The above was all I needed in order to be able to use the
[JMP](https://jmp.chat/) SMS-to-XMPP service.
