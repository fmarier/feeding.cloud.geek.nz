[mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) has excellent [OpenPGP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880) and [GPG](http://www.gnupg.org/) support. However different clients send GnuPG encrypted/signed data in different ways. Lots of people seem to be using [FireGPG](http://getfiregpg.org/) these days so that they can use GnuPG within the GMail/Hotmail/Yahoo! web clients.  
  
Here's the [procmail](http://www.procmail.org/) rule I used to convert almost all incoming emails to the OpenPGP/MIME format:  


    :0  
    * !^Content-Type: multipart/  
    * !^Content-Type: application/pgp  
    {  
     :0 fBw  
     * ^-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----  
     * ^-----END PGP MESSAGE-----  
     | formail \  
         -i "Content-Type: application/pgp; format=text; x-action=encrypt"  
      
     :0 fBw  
     * ^-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----  
     * ^-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----  
     * ^-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  
     | formail \  
         -i "Content-Type: application/pgp; format=text; x-action=sign"  
    }


However, this didn't actually work with FireGPG and the way that it puts encrypted messages inline. I eventually [found out](https://help.launchpad.net/ReadingOpenPgpMail) that putting this in my `~/.muttrc` would fix it:  


    set pgp_auto_decode=yes
