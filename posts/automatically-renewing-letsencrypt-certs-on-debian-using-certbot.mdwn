I use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
[TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) certificates
on my Debian servers along with the [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)
tool. Since I use the "temporary webserver" method of proving domain
ownership via the [ACME protocol](https://ietf-wg-acme.github.io/acme/), I
cannot use the cert renewal cronjob built into Certbot.

Instead, this is the script I put in `/etc/cron.daily/certbot-renew`:

    #!/bin/bash

    /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet --pre-hook "/bin/systemctl stop apache2.service" --post-hook "/bin/systemctl start apache2.service"

    pushd /etc/ > /dev/null
    /usr/bin/git add letsencrypt
    DIFFSTAT="$(/usr/bin/git diff --cached --stat)"
    if [ -n "$DIFFSTAT" ] ; then
        /usr/bin/git commit --quiet -m "Renewed letsencrypt certs"
        echo "$DIFFSTAT"
    fi
    popd > /dev/null

It temporarily disables my [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) webserver while it renews the
certificates and then only outputs something to STDOUT (since my cronjob
will email me any output) if certs have been renewed.

Since I'm using [etckeeper](https://etckeeper.branchable.com/) to keep track of config changes on my
servers, my renewal script also commits to the repository if any certs have
changed.

# External Monitoring

In order to catch mistakes or oversights, I use
[ssl-cert-check](https://packages.debian.org/stable/ssl-cert-check) to
monitor my domains once a day:

    ssl-cert-check -s fmarier.org -p 443 -q -a -e francois@fmarier.org

I also signed up with [Cert Spotter](https://sslmate.com/certspotter/) which
watches the
[Certificate Transparency](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/) log
and notifies me of any newly-issued certificates for my domains.

In other words, I get notified:

- if my cronjob fails and a cert is about to expire, or
- as soon as a new cert is issued.

The whole thing seems to work well, but if there's anything I could be doing
better, feel free to leave a comment!
