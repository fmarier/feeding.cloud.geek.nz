I had a very similar problem, and when I called the \"busy\" phone from a Sipdroid client it said that the codecs were incompatible.  The codecs were fine, but I [finally] noticed that I had been screwing with TLS and my Yealink desk phone had **call encryption** set to **Compulsory**. Switching it to optional allowed calls to flow again.  Hopefully this may save someone else some head banging. :-)
