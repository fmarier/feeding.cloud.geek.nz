In Jessie, systemd-timesyncd put out some logging information to syslog, everytime that it pinged the time server that gave you a time stamp, time correction and frequency correction information.  With Stretch, these log reports have been suppressed. Does anyone know how to get them back? I can't find anything in the documentation. 
Thanks,
