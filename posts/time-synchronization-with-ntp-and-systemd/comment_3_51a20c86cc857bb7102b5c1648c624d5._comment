systemd-timesyncd seems to have some nice features - it touches `/var/lib/systemd/clock` (or perhaps `/var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock` on Debian) after each successful sync, so it will at least move forward after reboot even before the network is up.

On the other hand there are situations where I would like a whole set of services to have a hard dependency on a successful time synchronisation before they will even try and start up, and this does not seem to be well-supported by systemd (see https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/5097 for more detail).

You say you had to `timedatectl set-ntp true` after you got timesyncd running, but that's not working for me and I'm curious about how long I should spend watching it before I see a \"Yes\" in the NTP sync status, and I wonder what I might be missing if I'm not seeing this even though timesyncd appears to be running without errors.
