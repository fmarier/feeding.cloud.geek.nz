I used to rely on [ifupdown](https://packages.debian.org/stable/ifupdown) to
bring up my [iptables](https://packages.debian.org/stable/iptables) firewall
automatically using a config like this in `/etc/network/interfaces`:

    allow-hotplug eth0
    iface eth0 inet dhcp
        pre-up /sbin/iptables-restore /etc/network/iptables.up.rules
        pre-up /sbin/ip6tables-restore /etc/network/ip6tables.up.rules

    allow-hotplug wlan0
    iface wlan0 inet dhcp
        pre-up /sbin/iptables-restore /etc/network/iptables.up.rules
        pre-up /sbin/ip6tables-restore /etc/network/ip6tables.up.rules

but that doesn't seem to work very well in the brave new
[NetworkManager](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager/)
world.

What does work reliably is a "pre-up" NetworkManager script, something
that gets run before a network interface is brought up. However,
despite what the
[documentation](https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/unstable/NetworkManager.html)
says, a dispatcher script in `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatched.d/` won't
work on my Debian and Ubuntu machines. Instead, I had to create a new
`iptables` script in `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-up.d/`:

    #!/bin/sh
    
    LOGFILE=/var/log/iptables.log
    
    if [ "$1" = lo ]; then
        echo "$0: ignoring $1 for \`$2'" >> $LOGFILE
        exit 0
    fi
    
    case "$2" in
        pre-up)
            echo "$0: restoring iptables rules for $1" >> $LOGFILE
            /sbin/iptables-restore /etc/network/iptables.up.rules >> $LOGFILE 2>&1
            /sbin/ip6tables-restore /etc/network/ip6tables.up.rules >> $LOGFILE 2>&1
            ;;
        *)
            echo "$0: nothing to do with $1 for \`$2'" >> $LOGFILE
            ;;
    esac
    
    exit 0

and then make that script executable:

    chmod a+x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-up.d/iptables

With this in place, I can put my iptables rules in the usual place
(`/etc/network/iptables.up.rules` and `/etc/network/ip6tables.up.rules`) and
use the handy `iptables-apply` and `ip6tables-apply` commands to test
any changes to my firewall rules.
