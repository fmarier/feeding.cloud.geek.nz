In-flight and hotel WiFi can be quite expensive and often insist on charging
users extra to connect multiple devices. In order to avoid that, it's
possible to easily create a WiFi hotspot using
[NetworkManager](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager) and a
[external USB WiFi
adapter](https://www.thinkpenguin.com/gnu-linux/penguin-wireless-n-usb-adapter-gnu-linux-tpe-n150usb).

# Creating the hotspot

The main trick is to right-click on the NetworkManager icon in the status
bar and select "Edit Connections..." (**not** "Create New WiFi Network..."
despite the promising name).

From there click the "+" button in the lower right then "WiFi" as the
Connection Type. I like to use the computer name as the "Connection name".

In the *WiFi* tab, set the following:

- SSID: machinename_nomap
- Mode: hotspot
- Device: (the device name of the USB WiFi adapter)

The `_nomap` suffix is there to opt out of the
[Google](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/1725632?hl=en) and
[Mozilla](https://location.services.mozilla.com/optout) location services
which could allow anybody to lookup sightings of your device around the
World.

In the *WiFi Security* tab:

- Security: WPA & WPA2 Personal
- Password: (a 63-character random password generated using `pwgen -s 63`)

While you may think that such a long password is inconvenient, it's now
possible to add the network automatically by simply [scanning a QR
code](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/encoding-wifi-access-point-passwords-qr-code/)
on your phone.

In the *IPv4 Settings* tab:

- Method: Shared to other computers

Finally, in the *IPv6 Settings* tab:

- Method: Ignore

I ended up with the following config in
`/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/machinename`:

    [connection]
    id=machinename
    uuid=<long UUID string>
    type=wifi
    interface-name=wl...
    permissions=
    timestamp=1578533792
    
    [wifi]
    mac-address=<MAC>
    mac-address-blacklist=
    mode=ap
    seen-bssids=<BSSID>
    ssid=machinename_nomap
    
    [wifi-security]
    key-mgmt=wpa-psk
    psk=<63-character password>
    
    [ipv4]
    dns-search=
    method=shared
    
    [ipv6]
    addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy
    dns-search=
    ip6-privacy=0
    method=ignore

# Firewall rules

In order for the packets to flow correctly, I opened up the following ports
on my machine's local firewall:

    -A INPUT -s 10.42.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT
    -A FORWARD -d 10.42.0.0/24 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    -A FORWARD -s 10.42.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -d 224.0.0.251 -s 10.42.0.1 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -d 239.255.255.250 -s 10.42.0.1 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -d 10.42.0.255 -s 10.42.0.1 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -d 10.42.0.1 -s 10.42.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT
