## Google Alerts

I have also signed up for the following [Google Alert](http://www.google.com/alerts):

> <table>
> <tr><td>Search terms:</td><td>`link:safe-rm.org.nz`</td>
> </tr>
> <tr><td>Type:</td><td>`Comprehensive`</td>
> </tr>
> <tr><td>Deliver to:</td><td>`Email`</td>
> </tr>
> <tr><td>How often:</td><td>`as-it-happens`</td>
> </tr></table>

which emails me anytime someone links to my project's homepage in one of the resources indexed by Google.
