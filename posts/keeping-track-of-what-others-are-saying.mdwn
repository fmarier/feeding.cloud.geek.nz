There are a few ways to easily keep track of what others are saying about your Free Software project. In a very popular project, you may already have enough feedback from its busy forum or mailing list, but in new and small projects, you often have to actively seek feedback/comments from end-users.  
  
Here are a few ways to find out what people are saying online about your project.  
  

## RSS Feeds

First of all, here are the RSS feeds I subscribe to for one of my projects ([safe-rm](http://www.safe-rm.org.nz/)):

  * [Technorati](http://feeds.technorati.com/search/safe-rm.org.nz) (blog posts)
  * [Twitter tweets](http://search.twitter.com/search.atom?q=safe-rm.org.nz) (tweets)
  * [Identica](http://identi.ca/search/notice/rss?q=safe-rm.org.nz) (notices)
  * [TweetMeme](http://rss.tweetmeme.com/domain/?host=http://safe-rm.org.nz) (tweets)
  * [BackTweets](http://backtweets.com/search.rss?q=safe-rm.org.nz) (tweets)
  * [Freshmeat](http://freshmeat.net/projects/safe-rm/comments.atom) (comments)
  * [Ohloh](http://www.ohloh.net/p/safe-rm/messages.rss) (journal entries)

  

## Google Alerts

I have also signed up for the following [Google Alert](http://www.google.com/alerts):

> <table>
> <tr><td>Search terms:</td><td>`link:safe-rm.org.nz`</td>
> </tr>
> <tr><td>Type:</td><td>`Comprehensive`</td>
> </tr>
> <tr><td>Deliver to:</td><td>`Email`</td>
> </tr>
> <tr><td>How often:</td><td>`as-it-happens`</td>
> </tr></table>

which emails me anytime someone links to my project's homepage in one of the resources indexed by Google.  
  

## Backtype Alerts

Finally, these [Backtype Alerts](http://www.backtype.com/alerts) notify me anytime safe-rm features in a blog comment:

  * `safe-rm`
  * `safe-rm.org.nz`

  
  
Anything else I should subscribe to or follow?
