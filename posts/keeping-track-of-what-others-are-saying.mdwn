There are a few ways to easily keep track of what others are saying about your Free Software project. In a very popular project, you may already have enough feedback from its busy forum or mailing list, but in new and small projects, you often have to actively seek feedback/comments from end-users.  
  
Here are a few ways to find out what people are saying online about your project.  
  

## Google Alerts

I have also signed up for the following [Google Alert](http://www.google.com/alerts):

- Search terms: `link:safe-rm.org.nz`
- Type: `Comprehensive`
- Deliver to: `Email`
- How often: `as-it-happens`

which emails me anytime someone links to my project's homepage in one of the resources indexed by Google.
