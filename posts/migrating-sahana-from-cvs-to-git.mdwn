Here is how I migrated the [Sahana](http://www.sahana.lk/) CVS [repository](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sahana/develop) to [git](http://gitscm.org/), as part of the work that the [Sahana New Zealand Cluster](https://launchpad.net/%7Esahana-nz) is gearing up to do.  
  
It was actually a lot simpler than I expected!  

## Simple import

In a newly created directory:

  1. Do the initial setup:  
`cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sahana.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sahana login`
  2. Run the migration:  
`git cvsimport -k -m -v -d:pserver:anonymous@sahana.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sahana sahana-phase2`
  3. Wait several hours for it to finish!

## Fixing the author names

The only thing I didn't like from the above import was that all of the commit authors were missing full names and email addresses.  
  
So I grabbed the [list of Sahana project members](http://sourceforge.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=127855) from Sourceforge and created a mappping like this in a text file:  


    ajuonline=Ajay Kumar <ajuonline@users.sourceforge.net>  
    akshits88=Akshit Sharma <akshits88@users.sourceforge.net>  
    bhyde=Ben Hyde <bhyde@users.sourceforge.net>


Then I ran the import with the `-A` parameter:  

<pre>
git cvsimport <b>-A username_map.txt</b> -k -m -v -d:pserver:anonymous@sahana.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sahana sahana-phase2
</pre>

## Syncing new commits

To keep the git repository in sync with CVS and collect any new commits, simply run the same `git cvsimport` command again.  
  
My next steps will be to setup an automated sync script to keep this repository up to date with the Sourceforge one.
