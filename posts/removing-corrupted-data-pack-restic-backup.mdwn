I recently ran into a corrupted data pack in a [Restic](https://restic.net/)
backup on my
[GnuBee](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/backing-up-to-gnubee2/). It led
to consistent failures during the `prune` operation:

Thanks to the [excellent support
forum](https://forum.restic.net/t/restic-prune-issue/3098/2), I was able to
resolve this issue by dropping a single snapshot.

First, I identified the snapshot which contained the offending pack:

    $ restic -r sftp:hostname.local: find --pack 8fac6efe99f2a103b0c9c57293a245f25aeac4146d0e07c2ab540d91f23d3bb5
    repository b0b0516c opened successfully, password is correct
    Found blob 2beffa460d4e8ca4ee6bf56df279d1a858824f5cf6edc41a394499510aa5af9e
     ... in file /home/francois/.local/share/akregator/Archive/http___udd.debian.org_dmd_feed_
         (tree 602b373abedca01f0b007fea17aa5ad2c8f4d11f1786dd06574068bf41e32020)
     ... in snapshot 5535dc9d (2020-06-30 08:34:41)

Then, I could simply drop that snapshot:

    $ restic -r sftp:hostname.local: forget 5535dc9d
    repository b0b0516c opened successfully, password is correct
    [0:00] 100.00%  1 / 1 files deleted

and run the `prune` command to remove the snapshot, as well as the incomplete
packs that were also mentioned in the above output but could never be
removed due to the other error:

    $ restic -r sftp:hostname.local: prune
    repository b0b0516c opened successfully, password is correct
