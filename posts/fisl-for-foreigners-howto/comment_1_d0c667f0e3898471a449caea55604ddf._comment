Hi,
I also was invited to this years FISL and enjoyed the event a lot.  Just one correction about the free Wifi at airports:  They want some details - but I never gave *my* details.  Any numbers, addresses, gender whatever they want will do.  Sometimes they want to have your flight number - well, usually you can pick a random flight from the schedule in front of you.  So they just gather *any* data, not *yours*.
