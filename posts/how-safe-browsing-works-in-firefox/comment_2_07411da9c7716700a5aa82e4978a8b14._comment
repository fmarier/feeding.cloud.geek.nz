This is what we do for small lists (all of the [Tracking Protection](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/how-tracking-protection-works-in-firefox/) lists, as well as the certificate whitelist on Windows: `goog-downloadwhite-digest256`).

As for the other lists (the ones that end in `-shavar` instead of `-digest256`), it's not practical the ship the whole list to each user because they are enormous and change a lot.
