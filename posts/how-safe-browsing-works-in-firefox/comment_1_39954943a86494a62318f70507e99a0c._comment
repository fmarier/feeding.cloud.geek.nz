> When requesting complete hashes for a 32-bit prefix, Firefox throws in a number of extra \"noise\" entries to obfuscate the original URL further.

We're now in 2016. Why isn't the complete sha256 hash trasferred in the initial list?

The complete list is usually downloaded only once (or may also be shipped with the browser)
and updates can be applied as differential updates thus reducing size.

This eliminates the 2nd step where the complete hash of the url is sent to the safe browsing provider.
