A practial solution to the problem is encfs. It is fuse based and works on top of a existing filesystem. The files are not encrypted in a big block file, but in separated files, so you needn't reserve space prior using. The usage of encfs is very easier than that of cryptmount. The speed could be a little slower. No root access is needed.
