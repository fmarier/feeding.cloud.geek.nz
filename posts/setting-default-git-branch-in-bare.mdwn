A bare repository in git does not include a checkout. So in order to set the default branch that users will get after they clone, you cannot use <tt>git-checkout <i>mybranch</i></tt>.  
  
Instead, if you want the default branch to be something other than `master`, you need to do this:  

<pre>
git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/<i>mybranch</i>
</pre>

Which will update the `HEAD` file in your repository so that it contains:  

<pre>
ref: refs/heads/<i>mybranch</i>
</pre>

This is well documented in the [`git-symbolic-ref` manpage](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-symbolic-ref.html) but it's not necessarily the first place you'd think of looking.
