I've been following [Planet Linux Australia](https://planet.linux.org.au/)
for many years and discovered many interesting FOSS blogs through it. I was
sad to see that it got [shut down a few weeks
ago](https://linux.org.au/saying-farewell-to-planet-linux-australia/) and so
I decided to manually add all of the feeds to my RSS reader to avoid missing
posts from people I have been indirectly following for years.

Since all feeds have been removed from the site, I recovered the list of
blogs available from an [old copy of the
site](https://web.archive.org/web/20200228054023/https://planet.linux.org.au/)
preserved by the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org).

Here is the [resulting `.opml`
file](/posts/list-planet-linux-australia-blogs/linuxaustralia.opml) if you'd
like to subscribe.

## Changes

Once I had the full list, I removed all blogs that are gone, empty or broken
(e.g. domain not resolving, returning a 404, various database or server
errors).

I updated the URLs of a few blogs which had moved but hadn't updated their
feeds on the planet. I also updated the name of a blogger who was still
listed under a previous last name.

Finally, I removed LA-specific tags from feeds since these are unlikely to
be used again.

## Work-arounds

The following LiveJournal feeds didn't work in my RSS reader but opened fine
in a browser:

- <https://ninjafoo.livejournal.com/data/rss>
- <https://certifiedwaif.livejournal.com/data/rss>
- <https://tau-iota-mu-c.livejournal.com/data/rss>
- <https://lathiat.livejournal.com/data/rss>

However since none of them have them updated in the last 7 years, I just
left them out.

A couple appear to be impossible to [fetch over
Tor](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/things-that-work-well-with-tor/),
presumably due to a [Cloudflare
setting](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/block-tor-and-vpns-from-accessing-my-website/134730/2):

- <https://www.jamver.id.au/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/index.rss>
- <https://www.rwhitby.net/feed>
- <https://blog.khax.net/feed/>
- <https://dalts.com/index.xml>
- <https://pento.net/feed/>

Since only the last two have been updated in the last 9 years, I added these
to Feedburner and added the following "proxied" URLs to my reader:

- <https://feeds.feedburner.com/SteveDaltonLA>
- <https://feeds.feedburner.com/GaryPendergastLA>

Similarly, I couldn't fetch the following over Tor for some other reasons:

- <http://algorithm.com.au/blog/files/rss.xml>
- <http://soundadvice.id.au/blog/index.atom>
- <http://www.bytebot.net/blog/archives/category/databases/feed>
- <http://levlafayette.com/blog/feed>
- <http://www.rowetel.com/?feed=rss2>
- <https://hamishtaylor.com.au/photekgraddft-hamish-taylors-blog?format=rss>

I excluded the first two which haven't been updated in 6 years and proxied
the other ones:

- <https://feeds.feedburner.com/ColinCharlesLA>
- <https://feeds.feedburner.com/LevLafayetteLA>
- <https://feeds.feedburner.com/DavidRoweLA>
- <https://feeds.feedburner.com/HamishTaylorLA>
