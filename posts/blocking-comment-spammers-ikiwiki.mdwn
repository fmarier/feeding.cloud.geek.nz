Despite comments on my ikiwiki blog being fully moderated, spammers have
been increasingly posting link spam comments on my blog. While I used to use
the [blogspam plugin](https://ikiwiki.info/plugins/blogspam/), the
underlying service was [likely retired circa
2017](https://blog.steve.fi/possibly_retiring_blogspam_net) and its [public
repositories](https://github.com/BlogSpam-net/) are all archived.

It turns out that there is a relatively simple way to drastically reduce the
amount of spam submitted to the moderation queue: ban the datacentre IP
addresses that spammers are using.

## Looking up AS numbers

It all starts by looking at the IP address of a submitted comment:

![](/posts/blocking-comment-spammers-ikiwiki/comment-spammer.png)

From there, we can look it up using `whois`:

    $ whois -r 2a0b:7140:1:1:5054:ff:fe66:85c5
    
    % This is the RIPE Database query service.
    % The objects are in RPSL format.
    %
    % The RIPE Database is subject to Terms and Conditions.
    % See https://docs.db.ripe.net/terms-conditions.html
    
    % Note: this output has been filtered.
    %       To receive output for a database update, use the "-B" flag.
    
    % Information related to '2a0b:7140:1::/48'
    
    % Abuse contact for '2a0b:7140:1::/48' is 'abuse@servinga.com'

    source:         RIPE
    
    % This query was served by the RIPE Database Query Service version 1.114 (SHETLAND)

The important bit here is this line:

    origin:         AS207408

which referts to [Autonomous System 207408](https://ipinfo.io/AS207408),
owned by a hosting company in Germany called
[Servinga](https://servinga.com/).

Alternatively, you can use this [WHOIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS) server with much better output:

    $ whois -h whois.cymru.com -v 2a0b:7140:1:1:5054:ff:fe66:85c5
    AS      | IP                                       | BGP Prefix          | CC | Registry | Allocated  | AS Name
    207408  | 2a0b:7140:1:1:5054:ff:fe66:85c5          | 2a0b:7140:1::/48    | DE | ripencc  | 2017-07-11 | SERVINGA-EE, DE

## Looking up IP blocks

[Autonomous Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_%28Internet%29) are
essentially organizations to which
[IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) and
[IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) blocks have been allocated.

These allocations can be looked up easily on the command line either using a
third-party service:

    $ curl -sL https://ip.guide/as207408 | jq .routes.v4 >> servinga
    $ curl -sL https://ip.guide/as207408 | jq .routes.v6 >> servinga

or a local database downloaded from [IPtoASN](https://iptoasn.com/).

This is what I ended up with in the case of Servinga:

    [
      "45.11.183.0/24",
      "80.77.25.0/24",
      "194.76.227.0/24"
    ]
    [
      "2a0b:7140:1::/48"
    ]

## Preventing comment submission

While I do want to eliminate this source of spam, I don't want to block
these datacentre IP addresses outright since legitimate users could be using
these servers as VPN endpoints or crawlers.

I therefore added the following to my Apache config to restrict the CGI
endpoint (used only for write operations such as commenting):

    <Location /blog.cgi>
            Include /etc/apache2/spammers.include
            Options +ExecCGI
            AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
    </Location>

and then put the following in `/etc/apache2/spammers.include`:

    <RequireAll>
        Require all granted
    
        # https://ipinfo.io/AS207408
        Require not ip 46.11.183.0/24
        Require not ip 80.77.25.0/24
        Require not ip 194.76.227.0/24
        Require not ip 2a0b:7140:1::/48
    </RequireAll>

Finally, I can restart the website and commit my changes:

    $ apache2ctl configtest && systemctl restart apache2.service
    $ git commit -a -m "Ban all IP blocks from Servinga"

## Future improvements

I will likely automate this process in the future, but at the moment my
blog can go for a week without a single spam message (down from dozens every
day). It's possible that I've already cut off the worst offenders.

I have published the [list I am currently using](https://gist.github.com/fmarier/75a64cbb60c5cbbc21f5026a019f1193).
