Mutt has a built-in feature for search the body of emails in the current mailbox (see ESC-b) but it's also possible to make this extremely fast by [plugging-in external tools](http://wiki.mutt.org/?UserStory/SearchingMail). Here's a quick description of my [mairix](http://www.rpcurnow.force9.co.uk/mairix/) setup.  
  
After installing the package,  

> apt-get install mairix

create a .mairixrc in your home directory containing something like:  

> base=/home/username/Mail  
maildir=inbox:archives*:sent*  
mbox=debian*:jokes  
mfolder=search  
database=/home/username/Mail/.mairix_database  

(This assumes that you store your mail in ~/Mail and that you want the search results in a new ~/Mail/search maildir folder.)  
  
Then you need to run mairix once to index all of your emails:  

> mairix  

which you will of course want to run regularly. I created this cronjob in /etc/cron.d/mairix-username:  

> 17,37,57 * * * * username /usr/bin/on_ac_power && /usr/bin/mairix

(To avoid waking up the hard drive needlessly, I prefer to restrict the indexing runs for when I'm running on AC power. Take that out if you're not running it on a laptop.)  
  
Finally, the last bit of setup is in ~/.muttrc:  

> macro index \eb 'c=search'<enter><shell-escape>'mairix ' 'Enter Mairix search term'  

which makes mairix take over the ESC-b shortcut.  
  
If you use GPG, you should also add this to your ~/.muttrc to make sure that mairix can see all of your messages by saving them as clear text:  

> set fcc_clear=yes  
bind index s decrypt-save  
bind pager s decrypt-save
