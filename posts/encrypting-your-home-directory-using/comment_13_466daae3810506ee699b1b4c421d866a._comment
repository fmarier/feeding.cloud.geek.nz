If you get errors during `umount /home`, you may need to end your graphical shell and login as root before mounting /home. On Debian, e.g., you can do this by pressing CTRL+ALT+F{1,2,3,4} at a graphical login prompt before logging in as a regular user, and then logging in as `root` from there. This way, `lsof /home` should return nothing and you should be able to unmount /home without error.
