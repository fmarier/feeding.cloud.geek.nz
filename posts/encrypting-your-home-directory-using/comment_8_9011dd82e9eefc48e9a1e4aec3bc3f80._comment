Why not encrypt the temporary partition too, to prevent you having to hope wipe/shred etc. are thorough enough? Also a tarpipe ((cd /home/foo; tar c . ) | ( cd /tmp/foo; tar x )) or rsync would be better than cp -a (and cp -a /home/foo /tmp/foo would be better than the glob which could expand to too many arguments for the command line and will exclude dotfiles)
