Why not start with basics:  
1. Set a strong BIOS password  
2. Disable (in BIOS) booting from removable media  
3. Set a global GRUB password, so ALL options in menulist require a password.  
  
The ordinary thief will already pass after encountering those obstacles.  
  
Then encrypt your home partition.
