Hello,

After some searching online I tried to update the BIOS on an Ideapad 120s via USB bootable stick with DOS.

How to flash via DOS boot usb.........


01. First you need Rufus and an 1GB USB stick - what I had for a stick

01a. create a usb dos boot disk with rufus

02. You need the BIOS, ex 6gcn25ww.exe

03. on an Linux machine you use innoextract to extract the executable fron the auto-unpacking archive. will have same name and extension

04. you put the newly obtained exec in the root of the dos boot usb stick

05. boot the machine with said usb stick

06. type the name of .exe file at the promt, wait for extract process, wait for reboot, let the exe do its job - a new boot window will appear with the progress bar.....wait some more.....wait til machine reboots......check new bios......success !


finish

My 2 cents for people with noob skills on Linux.

I hope it will help someone....

Best regards
