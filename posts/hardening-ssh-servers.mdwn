These are the settings that I use on my servers. You may want to also review
the [settings that are used at Mozilla](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/openssh).

# Basic configuration

There are a few basic things that most admins will already know (and that
[tiger](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/tiger/) will warn you about if
you forget):

* only allow [version 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell#Version_2.x) of the protocol
* disable root logins
* disable password authentication

This is what `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` should contain:

    HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
    HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
    HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
    AuthenticationMethods publickey
    PasswordAuthentication no
    PermitRootLogin no
    AuthorizedKeysFile      .ssh/authorized_keys

Once you've done that, make sure you have all of the required host keys by running:

    ssh-keygen -A

as root.

You may also want to ensure you are using [strong ciphers and hash functions](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Guidelines/OpenSSH#OpenSSH_server):

    KexAlgorithms <insert Mozilla list>
    Ciphers <insert Mozilla list>
    MACs <insert Mozilla list>

and that you deactivate short Diffie-Hellman moduli:

    awk '$5 >= 3071' /etc/ssh/moduli > /etc/ssh/moduli.tmp
    mv /etc/ssh/moduli.tmp /etc/ssh/moduli

Finally, if you don't need `sftp` support, Mozilla recommends disabling it,
which can be done by commenting out this line:

    #Subsystem     sftp    /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server

On the other hand, if you do need it, it's generally better to replace it
with the [internal sftp
server](https://serverfault.com/questions/660160/openssh-difference-between-internal-sftp-and-sftp-server#660325):

    Subsystem     sftp    internal-sftp

# Whitelist approach to giving users ssh access

To ensure that only a few users have ssh access to the server and that newly
created users don't have it enabled by default, create a new group:

    addgroup sshuser

and then add the relevant users to it:

    adduser francois sshuser

Finally, add this to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

    AllowGroups sshuser

# Deterring brute-force (or dictionary) attacks

One way to ban attackers who try to brute-force your ssh server is to
install the [fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)
package. It keeps an eye on the ssh log file (`/var/log/auth.log`) and
temporarily blocks IP addresses after a number of failed login attempts.

To prevent your own IP addresses from being blocked, add them to
`/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/local.conf`:

    [DEFAULT]
    ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 1.2.3.4

Another approach is to hide the ssh service using
[Single-Packet Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Packet_Authorization). I
have [fwknop](http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/) installed on some of my
servers and use small
[wrapper](https://github.com/fmarier/user-scripts/blob/master/spassh)
[scripts](https://github.com/fmarier/user-scripts/blob/master/spascp)
to connect to them.

# Restricting shell access

For those users who only need an ssh account on the server in order to
transfer files (using `scp` or `rsync`), it's a good idea to restrict their
access further. I used to switch these users' shell (via [chsh](http://linux.die.net/man/1/chsh)) to a restricted one like
[rssh](http://www.pizzashack.org/rssh/), but that project has been
[abandoned](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1033905/removed-234-12-from-unstable/).

I now use a [different
approach](https://www.allthingsdigital.nl/2013/05/12/setting-up-an-sftp-only-account-with-openssh/)
which consists of using an essentially empty chroot for these users and
limiting them to `internal-sftp` by putting the following in
`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

    Match Group sftponly
      ForceCommand internal-sftp
      ChrootDirectory /mnt/data

creating a group:

    adduser sftponly

and a base chroot directory:

    mkdir -p /mnt/data/home

Note that the base directory, and each parent directory all the way to the
root directory, must be owned by `root:root` (user **and** group) otherwise
you'll see an unhelpful error message like this when you try to connect via
sftp:

    $ sftp user1@server.example
    client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe

Then for each user, we need to do the following:

    adduser user1 sftp-only
    chsh user1 -s /bin/false
    mkdir -p /mnt/data/home/user1
    chown user1:user1 /mnt/data/home/user1
    chmod 700 /mnt/data/home/user1

before restarting the ssh daemon:

    systemctl restart sshd.service

Should one of these users attempt to connect via ssh instead of stp, they
will see the following:

    $ ssh user1@server.example
    This service allows sftp connections only.
    Connection to server.example closed.

# Restricting authorized keys to certain IP addresses

In addition to listing all of the public keys that are allowed to log into a
user account, the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file also allows (as the
[man page](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&sektion=8#SSHRC)
points out) a user to impose a number of restrictions.

Perhaps the most useful option is *from* which allows a user to restrict the
IP addresses which can login using a specific key.

Here's what one of my `authorized_keys` looks like:

    from="192.0.2.2" ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nz...zvCn bot@example

You may also want to include the following options to each entry:
`no-X11-forwarding`, `no-user-rc`, `no-pty`, `no-agent-forwarding` and
`no-port-forwarding`.

# Increasing the amount of logging

Ff you run [logcheck](https://packages.debian.org/stable/logcheck)
and would like to whitelist the "Accepted publickey" messages on your
server, you'll have to start by deleting the first line of
`/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server/sshd`. Then you can add an entry for all of
the usernames, IP addresses and ssh keys that you expect to see.

Finally, it is also possible to
[log all commands issued by a specific user over ssh](http://beardyjay.co.uk/logging-all-ssh-commands/logging-ssh)
by enabling the `pam_tty_audit` module in `/etc/pam.d/sshd`:

    session required pam_tty_audit.so enable=francois

However this module is [not included in wheezy](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=699159) and has only recently been [re-added to Debian](http://packages.qa.debian.org/p/pam/news/20131021T001835Z.html).

# Identifying stolen keys

One thing I'd love to have is a way to identify a stolen public key. Given the IP
restrictions described above, if a public key is stolen and used from a different IP,
I will see something like this in `/var/log/auth.log`:

    sshd: Connection from 198.51.100.10 port 39492
    sshd: Authentication tried for francois with correct key but not from a permitted host (host=198.51.100.10, ip=198.51.100.10).
    sshd: Failed publickey for francois from 198.51.100.10 port 39492 ssh2
    sshd: Connection closed by 198.51.100.10 [preauth]

So I can get the IP address of the attacker (likely to be a random VPS or a
Tor exit node), but unfortunately, the key fingerprints don't appear for
failed connections like they do for successful ones. So I don't know which key
to revoke.

Is there any way to identify which key was used in a failed login attempt or
is the solution to only ever have a single public key in each
`authorized_keys` file and create a separate user account for each user?
