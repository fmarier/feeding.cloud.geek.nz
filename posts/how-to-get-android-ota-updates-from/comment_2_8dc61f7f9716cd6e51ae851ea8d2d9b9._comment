Hey Man ,   
  
Thanks a lot for this informative blog .   
  
I happen to be in the same boat now Since I bought My Nexus from my sis who happens to live in Singapore( I live in INDIA), and the phone is a yakjujp make from middle east, probably UAE, and i have been stuck at 4.0.4 ICS update while many of my friends have 4.1 jellybean .. I was just as shocked as everyone else has been when i came to know of the yakju/yakjujp update story after buying the phone ,it is seriously irritating and frustrating to see a company cheat us so badly , Worse there is no proper in fact not a systematic way to get in touch for support form Google !   
  
Coming to the point of discovering what make the phone is ( yakju/yakjujp) and who takes care of update for phone, we can find that by checking the "ABOUT" section in the settings part of GOOGLE MAPS .. there all details are given , as is in mine which is :   
PLATFORM -- android:samsung-maguro-galaxy Nexus  
  
Device : Samsung Yakjujp  
  
this is simpler than opening the file inside teh android system to check for details .   
  
Buddy now can you do me a favour and let me know a link or process where a step by step guide to upgrade to 4.1 jellybean is given from 4.0.4 ( mine is international unlocked version )   
  
Also i'm kinda new to this , but did read a good amount of forums and pages on this .. and zeroed in on you as you too had "yakjujp" variant of Nexus .   
  
Would be happy if you could suggest me a way out of this mess .   
  
Also does it take 8 weeks or in worse cases longer than that to get updates ??  
  
Thanks & Regards
