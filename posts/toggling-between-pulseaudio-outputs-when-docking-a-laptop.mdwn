In addition to
[selecting the right monitor after docking my ThinkPad](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/hooking-into-docking-undocking-events-to-run-scripts/),
I wanted to set the correct sound output since I have headphones connected
to my Ultra Dock. This can be done fairly easily using
[Pulseaudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/).

# Switching to a different pulseaudio output

To find the device name and the output name I need to provide to `pacmd`, I
ran `pacmd list-sinks`:

    2 sink(s) available.
    ...
      * index: 1
    	name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo>
    	driver: <module-alsa-card.c>
    ...
    	ports:
    		analog-output: Analog Output (priority 9900, latency offset 0 usec, available: unknown)
    			properties:
    				
    		analog-output-speaker: Speakers (priority 10000, latency offset 0 usec, available: unknown)
    			properties:
    				device.icon_name = "audio-speakers"

From there, I extracted the soundcard name
(`alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo`) and the names of the two
output ports (`analog-output` and `analog-output-speaker`).

To switch between the headphones and the speakers, I can therefore run the
following commands:

    pacmd set-sink-port alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo analog-output
    pacmd set-sink-port alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo analog-output-speaker

# Listening for headphone events

Then I looked for the ACPI event triggered when my headphones are detected
by the laptop after docking.

After looking at the output of `acpi_listen`, I found `jack/headphone HEADPHONE plug`.

Combining this with the above pulseaudio names, I put the following in
`/etc/acpi/events/thinkpad-dock-headphones`:

    event=jack/headphone HEADPHONE plug
    action=su francois -c "pacmd set-sink-port alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo analog-output"

to automatically switch to the headphones when I dock my laptop.

# Finding out whether or not the laptop is docked

While it is possible to
[hook into the docking and undocking ACPI events and run scripts](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/hooking-into-docking-undocking-events-to-run-scripts/),
there doesn't seem to be an easy way from a shell script to tell whether or
not the laptop is docked.

In the end, I settled on detecting the presence of USB devices.

I ran `lsusb` twice (once docked and once undocked) and then compared the
output:

    lsusb  > docked 
    lsusb  > undocked 
    colordiff -u docked undocked 

This gave me a number of differences since I have a bunch of peripherals
attached to the dock:

I picked `17ef:1010` as it appeared to be some internal bus on the Ultra
Dock (none of my USB devices were connected to Bus 003) and then ended up
with the following
[port toggling script](https://github.com/fmarier/user-scripts/blob/master/toggle-pulseaudio-port):

    #!/bin/bash
    
    if /usr/bin/lsusb | grep 17ef:1010 > /dev/null ; then
        # docked
        pacmd set-sink-port alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo analog-output
    else
        # undocked
        pacmd set-sink-port alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo analog-output-speaker
