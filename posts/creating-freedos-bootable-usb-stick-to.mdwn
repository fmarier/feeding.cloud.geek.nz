I have an old motherboard that requires creating a DOS boot floppy in order to upgrade its BIOS. Fortunately, it's not too hard to do this with [FreeDOS](http://www.freedos.org/) and a USB stick.

_The instructions below are based on an [old FDos wiki article](https://web.archive.org/web/20090301055636/http://wiki.fdos.org/Installation/BootDiskCreateUSB).
You maye have more luck with the [latest instructions from the official wiki](http://wiki.freedos.org/wiki/index.php/USB)_


### Downloading the dependencies

The first step is to download the required files from your motherboard manufacturer:

  * the latest BIOS image
  * the BIOS flashing program

and then install the tools you'll need:

    apt-get install makebootfat syslinux

### Preparing the "floppy" image

Start by collecting all of the files you need to install FreeDOS on the USB stick:

    cd /tmp
    
    wget https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.0/pkgs/commandx.zip
    wget https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.0/pkgs/kernels.zip
    wget https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.0/pkgs/substx.zip
    wget https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.0/pkgs/unstablx.zip
    
    for ZIP in *.zip; do unzip $ZIP; done
    
    cp ./source/ukernel/boot/fat16.bin  .
    cp ./source/ukernel/boot/fat12.bin .
    cp ./source/ukernel/boot/fat32lba.bin .
    
    cp /usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin .

and then create a directory for the files that will end up in the root directory of the "floppy":

    mkdir /tmp/fs-root
    cp ./bin/command.com /tmp/fs-root/
    cp ./bin/kernel.sys  /tmp/fs-root/

and copy the BIOS image and update program into that same directory (`/tmp/fs-root/`).

### Creating a bootable USB stick

Plug in a [FAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table)-formatted USB stick and look for the device it uses (`/dev/sdb` in the example below).

Finally, run `makebootfat`:

<pre>
/usr/bin/makebootfat -o <i>/dev/sdb</i> -E 255 -1 fat12.bin -2 fat16.bin -3 fat32lba.bin -m mbr.bin /tmp/fs-root
</pre>
