I would expect that you would do the unbundle, then move your bookmark back to 'tip' (which should be last unbundled changeset). I would think:

    hg unbundle ~/devel/mozilla-unified/.hg/strip-backup/47906774d58d-ae1953e1-backup.hg
    hg bookmark -r tip hashstore-crash-1434206-recovered

though I would probably do `hg log -G` to verify it's the one you want. Or `hg log --template list -G`.
