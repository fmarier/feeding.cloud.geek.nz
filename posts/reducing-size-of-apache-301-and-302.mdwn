Looking through the [Libravatar](https://www.libravatar.org/) access logs, I found that most of the traffic we currently serve consists of 302 redirects to Gravatar. Optimising that path is therefore very important.  
  
While Apache allows admins to provide [custom error pages](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#errordocument) for things like 404 or 500, it's not quite that straightforward for 30x return codes.  
  

### Standard 301 / 302 responses

By default, Apache (and most web servers out there) returns a fairly large HTML page along with a 30x redirection. Try it for yourself by disabling automatic redirections in Firefox (Preferences | Advanced | General | Accessibility) or by installing the [Request Policy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy/?src=search) add-on.  
  
The 302 responses sent by Libravatar looked like this:  


    $ curl -i http://cdn.libravatar.org/avatar/12345678901234567890123456789012  
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found  
    Date: Wed, 21 Sep 2011 01:51:52 GMT  
    Server: Apache  
    Cache-Control: max-age=86400  
    Location: http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12345678901234567890123456789012.jpg?r=g&s=80&d=http://cdn.libravatar.org/nobody/80.png  
    Vary: Accept-Encoding  
    Content-Length: 310  
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1  
      
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">  
    <html><head>  
    <title>302 Found</title>  
    </head><body>  
    <h1>Found</h1>  
    <p>The document has moved <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12345678901234567890123456789012.jpg?r=g&s=80&d=http://cdn.libravatar.org/nobody/80.png">here</a>.</p>  
    </body></html>  
    


As you can see, the body of the response is just as large as the headers and isn't really necessary.  
  

### Body-less 301 responses

After reading about the [ErrorDocument directive](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/custom-error.html), I created an empty file called `302` in the root of the web server and included this directive in my vhost configuration file:  


    ErrorDocument 302 /302


which made the responses look like this:  


    $ curl -i http://example.com/redir  
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found  
    Date: Wed, 21 Sep 2011 03:39:26 GMT  
    Server: Apache  
    Last-Modified: Wed, 21 Sep 2011 03:39:17 GMT  
    ETag: "8024d-0-4ad6b52201036"  
    Accept-Ranges: bytes  
    Content-Length: 0  
    Content-Type: text/plain  
      
    


This one does have a completely empty body, however, there's an important problem with this solution: the `Location` header is missing! Not much point in reducing the size of the redirect if it's no longer working.  
  

### Custom 302 response page

The next thing I tried (and ended up settling on) is this:  


    ErrorDocument 302 " "


which results in a 1-byte response (a single space) in the body:  


    $ curl -i http://example.com/redir  
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found  
    Date: Wed, 21 Sep 2011 03:37:50 GMT  
    Server: Apache  
    Location: http://www.example.com  
    Vary: Accept-Encoding  
    Content-Length: 1  
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1  
      
    


There is still a little bit of unnecessary information in this response (character set, `Vary` and `Server` headers), but it's a major improvement over the original.  
  
If you know of any other ways to reduce this further, please leave a comment!
