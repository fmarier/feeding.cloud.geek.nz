Two months ago, Troy Hunt, the security professional behind
[Have I been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/),
[released](https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/)
an incredibly comprehensive
[password list](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) in the hope that it
would allow web developers to steer their users away from passwords that
have been compromised in past breaches.

While the list released by HIBP is hashed, the plaintext passwords are out
there and one should assume that password crackers have access to them.
So if you use a password on that list, you can be fairly confident
that it's very easy to guess or crack your password.

I wanted to check my **active** passwords against that list to check whether
or not any of them are compromised and should be changed immediately. This
meant that I needed to download the list and do these lookups locally since
it's not a good idea to send your current passwords to this third-party
service.

I put my tool up on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/hibp-pwlookup) /
[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hibp-pwlookup) and you are more than
welcome to give it a go. Install [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and
[Psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/) and then follow the
[README instructions](https://git.launchpad.net/hibp-pwlookup/tree/README.txt)
to setup your database.
