If you use [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for Javascript or [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) development, you should have a look at [js2-mode](https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode) (`apt-get install js2-mode` in [Debian](http://packages.debian.org/sid/js2-mode) / [Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/js2-mode)).

In addition to providing syntax highlight, it will parse your Javascript and issue errors and warnings. (It's not as pedantic as [jslint](http://www.jslint.com/) or [jshint](http://www.jshint.com/) so you'll probably want to fix all of them before committing your files.)

Unfortunately the default indentation style looks a bit crazy and adds excessive indentation to your code. Here's an example:


      
        navigator.id.secret.generate(identity, function (plainKey, wrappedKey) {  
                                         var data = {wrappedKey: wrappedKey};  
                                         $.post('/loggedin', data, function (res) {  
                                                    $("#message").text('All done');  
                                                }, 'json');  
                                     }, function (error) {  
                                         $("#message").text('ERROR: ' + error);  
                                     });  
    


It turns out that [indenting Javascript properly is really hard](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.nz/2008_03_01_archive.html), but you can turn on a special flag which will cause the indentation to "bounce" between different strategies, starting with the most likely one.

This is what I now have in my `~/.emacs`:


    (custom-set-variables  
     '(js2-basic-offset 2)  
     '(js2-bounce-indent-p t)  
    )


You can find and configure all other options by issuing the following command:

> M-x customize-group [RET] js2-mode [RET]

So yes, you can have both the reasonable indentation of the standard [js-mode](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/JavaScriptMode) and the helpful warnings and errors of [js2-mode](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Js2Mode)!
