In order to be able to use the [webroot
plugin](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#webroot) for
[certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) and automatically renew the [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate for `libravatar.org`, I
had to put together an Apache config that would do the following on port 80:

- Let `/.well-known/acme-challenge/*` through on the bare domain
  (`http://libravatar.org/`).
- Redirect anything else to `https://www.libravatar.org/`.

The reason for this is that the main
[Libravatar](https://www.libravatar.org) service listens on
`www.libravatar.org` and not `libravatar.org`, but that cerbot needs to
ascertain control of the bare domain.

This is the configuration I ended up with:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot /var/www/acme
        <Directory /var/www/acme>
            Options -Indexes
        </Directory>
    
        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteCond "/var/www/acme%{REQUEST_URI}" !-f
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.libravatar.org/ [last,redirect=301]
    </VirtualHost>

The trick I used here is to make the redirection `RewriteRule` conditional
on the requested file (`%{REQUEST_URI}`) not existing in the `/var/www/acme`
directory, the one where I tell certbot to drop its temporary files.

Here are the relevant portions of `/etc/letsencrypt/renewal/www.libravatar.org.conf`:

    [renewalparams]
    authenticator = webroot
    account = 
    
    \[[webroot_map]]
    libravatar.org = /var/www/acme
    www.libravatar.org = /var/www/acme
