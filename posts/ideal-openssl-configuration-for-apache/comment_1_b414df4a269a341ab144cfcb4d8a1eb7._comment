RC4, while avoiding the attack-flavor-of-the-day, provides relatively weak security compared to other ciphers. Consider the various guides pointing out that "ssh -c arcfour" goes faster but at the expense of some security, and thus that you should not use it on insecure networks.  
  
Instead, I'd suggest preferring TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.1, both of which address the BEAST attack and other problems. As far as I know, those already appear earlier in the preference list than TLSv1, though you should check that.
