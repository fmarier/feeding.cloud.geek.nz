"Are there any other ways of making sure that DNSSEC is fully functional?"  
  
The following will give some info on dnssec. Install unbound-host, then try the following:  
  
$ unbound-host rhybar.cz -f /etc/unbound/root.key -v  
  
Output:  
rhybar.cz has no address (BOGUS (security failure))  
validation failure : no keys have a DS with algorithm RSASHA1 from 194.0.12.1 for key rhybar.cz. while building chain of trust  
  
Or:  
$ unbound-host rhybar.cz -C /etc/unbound/unbound.conf -v  
  
Also:  
  
$ unbound-host dnssec.cz -C /etc/unbound/unbound.conf -v  
  
Output:  
dnssec.cz has address 217.31.205.50 (secure)  
dnssec.cz has IPv6 address 2001:1488:0:3::2 (secure)  
dnssec.cz mail is handled by 10 mail.nic.cz. (secure)  
dnssec.cz mail is handled by 15 mail4.nic.cz. (secure)  
dnssec.cz mail is handled by 20 mx.cznic.org. (secure)  
  
Or:  
  
$ unbound-host dnssec.cz -f /etc/unbound/root.key -v
