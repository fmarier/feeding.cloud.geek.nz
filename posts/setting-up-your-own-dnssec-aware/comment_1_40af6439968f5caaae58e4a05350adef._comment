First, Thank You for posting this. There is one more thing that needs to be done.  
  
After following: http://www.unbound.net/documentation/howto_anchor.html  
  
I was getting this error in /var/log/daemon.log:  
  
error: Could not open autotrust file for writing, /etc/unbound/root.key: Permission denied  
  
I changed the group to unbound and made it writable.  
  
\# cd /etc/unbound  
\# chgrp unbound root.key  
\# chmod g+w root.key  
\# ls -la root.key  
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root unbound 758 Sep 21 16:46 root.key  
  
After restarting unbound, no more errors. The root.key should look like the following:  
  
; autotrust trust anchor file  
;;id: . 1  
;;last_queried: 1285101992 ;;Tue Sep 21 16:46:32 2010  
;;last_success: 1285101992 ;;Tue Sep 21 16:46:32 2010  
;;next_probe_time: 1285141647 ;;Wed Sep 22 03:47:27 2010  
;;query_failed: 0  
;;query_interval: 43200  
;;retry_time: 8640  
. 86400 IN DNSKEY 257 3 8 AwEAAagAI......  
  
Again Thank You, for this post.
