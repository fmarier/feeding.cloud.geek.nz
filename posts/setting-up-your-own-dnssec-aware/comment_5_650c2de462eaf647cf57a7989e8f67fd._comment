We figured it out:

In order for OpenVPN to use the locally installed Unbound DNS resolver, do this:

First check for the IP we should use with: sudo ifconfig

The IP we need is the one listed at 

tun0: inet 10.8.0.1 

UNBOUND

Add this to /etc/unbound/unbound.conf

server:
    interface: 127.0.0.1
    interface: 10.8.0.1
    access-control: 127.0.0.1 allow
    access-control: 10.8.0.1/24 allow

Then restart Unbound with: sudo service unbound restart

Test with: dig @10.8.0.1 google.com
(SERVER should read: SERVER: 10.8.0.1#53(10.8.0.1))

OPENVPN

Add this to (or modify) /etc/openvpn/server.conf

push \"redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp\"
push \"dhcp-option DNS 10.8.0.1\"
push \"register-dns\"

Then restart OpenVPN with: sudo service openvpn restart

OpenVPN clients should now be using Unbound. Test at http://dnsleak.com/
