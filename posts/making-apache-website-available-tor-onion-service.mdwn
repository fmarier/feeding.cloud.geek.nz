As part of the [#MoreOnionsPorFavor
campaign](https://blog.torproject.org/more-onions-porfavor), I decided to
follow [`brave.com`'s lead](https://brave.com/new-onion-service/) and make
my [homepage](https://fmarier.org) available as a [Tor onion
service](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-onion-service.html.en).

## Tor daemon setup

I started by installing the Tor daemon locally:

    apt install tor

and then setting the following in `/etc/tor/torrc`:

    SocksPort 0
    SocksPolicy reject *
    HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
    HiddenServicePort 80 [2600:3c04::f03c:91ff:fe8c:61ac]:80
    HiddenServicePort 443 [2600:3c04::f03c:91ff:fe8c:61ac]:443
    HiddenServiceVersion 3
    HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 1
    HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 1

in order to create a [version 3 onion
service](https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline) without
actually running a [Tor relay](https://community.torproject.org/relay/).

Note that since I am making a public website available over Tor, I do not
need the location of the website to be hidden and so I used the same
settings as
[Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-onion-service/) in their
public Tor proxy.

Also, I explicitly used the **external IPv6 address** of my server in the
configuration in order to prevent [localhost
bypasses](https://riseup.net/en/security/network-security/tor/onionservices-best-practices#be-careful-of-localhost-bypasses).

After restarting the Tor daemon to reload the configuration file:

    systemctl restart tor.service

I looked for the address of my onion service:

    $ cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname 
    ixrdj3iwwhkuau5tby5jh3a536a2rdhpbdbu6ldhng43r47kim7a3lid.onion

## Apache configuration

Next, I enabled a few required Apache modules:

    a2enmod mpm_event
    a2enmod http2
    a2enmod headers

and configured my Apache vhosts in `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/www.conf`:

    <VirtualHost *:443>
        ServerName fmarier.org
        ServerAlias ixrdj3iwwhkuau5tby5jh3a536a2rdhpbdbu6ldhng43r47kim7a3lid.onion
    
        Protocols h2, http/1.1
        Header set Onion-Location "http://ixrdj3iwwhkuau5tby5jh3a536a2rdhpbdbu6ldhng43r47kim7a3lid.onion%{REQUEST_URI}s"
        Header set alt-svc 'h2="ixrdj3iwwhkuau5tby5jh3a536a2rdhpbdbu6ldhng43r47kim7a3lid.onion:443"; ma=315360000; persist=1'
        Header add Strict-Transport-Security: "max-age=63072000"
    
        Include /etc/fmarier-org/www-common.include
    
        SSLEngine On
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/fmarier.org/fullchain.pem
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/fmarier.org/privkey.pem
    </VirtualHost>
    
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName fmarier.org
        Redirect permanent / https://fmarier.org/
    </VirtualHost>
         
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName ixrdj3iwwhkuau5tby5jh3a536a2rdhpbdbu6ldhng43r47kim7a3lid.onion
        Include /etc/fmarier-org/www-common.include
    </VirtualHost>

Note that `/etc/fmarier-org/www-common.include` contains all of the
configuration options that are common to both the HTTP and the HTTPS sites
(e.g. document root, caching headers, aliases, etc.).

Finally, I restarted Apache:

    apache2ctl configtest
    systemctl restart apache2.service

## Testing

In order to test that my website is correctly available at its `.onion`
address, I opened the following URLs in a [Brave Tor
window](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018121491-What-is-a-Private-Window-with-Tor-):

- <http://ixrdj3iwwhkuau5tby5jh3a536a2rdhpbdbu6ldhng43r47kim7a3lid.onion/>
- <https://ixrdj3iwwhkuau5tby5jh3a536a2rdhpbdbu6ldhng43r47kim7a3lid.onion/> (a TLS certificate error is expected)

I also checked that the main URL (<https://fmarier.org/>) exposes a working
[`Onion-Location` header](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/onion-location/)
which triggers the display of a button in the URL bar (recently [merged](https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/6762)
and available in [Brave Nightly](https://brave.com/download-nightly/)):

![](/posts/making-apache-website-available-tor-onion-service/onion-location.png)

Testing that the `Alt-Svc` is working also required using the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/)
since that's [not yet supported in
Brave](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/1121):

1. Open <https://fmarier.org>.
2. Wait 30 seconds.
3. Reload the page.

On the server side, I saw the following:

    2a0b:f4c2:2::1 - - [14/Oct/2020:02:42:20 +0000] "GET / HTTP/2.0" 200 2696 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0"
    2600:3c04::f03c:91ff:fe8c:61ac - - [14/Oct/2020:02:42:53 +0000] "GET / HTTP/2.0" 200 2696 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0"

That first IP address is from a Tor exit node:

    $ whois 2a0b:f4c2:2::1
    ...
    inet6num:       2a0b:f4c2::/40
    netname:        MK-TOR-EXIT
    remarks:        -----------------------------------
    remarks:        This network is used for Tor Exits.
    remarks:        We do not have any logs at all.
    remarks:        For more information please visit:
    remarks:        https://www.torproject.org

which indicates that the first request was **not using** the `.onion`
address.

The second IP address is the one for my server:

    $ dig +short -x 2600:3c04::f03c:91ff:fe8c:61ac
    hafnarfjordur.fmarier.org.

which indicates that the second request to Apache came from the Tor relay
running on my server, hence **using** the `.onion` address.
