[Gearman](http://www.gearman.org) is a queuing system that [has been in Debian](http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=gearman-job-server) for a long time and is quite reliable.

I ran into problems however when upgrading a server from Debian squeeze to wheezy however. Here's how I debugged my Gearman setup.

# Log verbosity

First of all, I started by increasing the verbosity level of the daemon by adding `--verbose=INFO` to `/etc/default/gearman-job-server` (the possible values of the `verbose` option are in the [libgearman documentation](http://gearman.info/libgearman/gearman_verbose_t.html)) and restarting the daemon:

    /etc/init.d/gearman-job-server restart

I opened a second terminal to keep an eye on the logs:

    tail -f /var/log/gearman-job-server/gearman.log

# Listing available workers

Next, I registered a very simple worker:

    gearman -w -f mytest cat

and made sure it was connected properly by telneting into the Gearman process:

    telnet localhost 4730

and listing all currently connected workers using the `workers` command (one of the commands available in the [Gearman TEXT protocol](http://gearman.info/protocol/text.html)).

There should be an entry similar to this one:

    30 127.0.0.1 - : mytest

Because there are no `exit` or `quit` commands in the TEXT protocol, you need to terminate the telnet connection like this:

1. Press Return
2. Press Ctrl + ]
3. Press Return
4. Type `quit` at the telnet prompt and press Return.

Finally, I sent some input to the simple worker I setup earlier:

    echo "hi there" | gearman -f mytest

and got my input repeated on the terminal:

    hi there

# Gearman bug

I traced my problems down to this error message when I sent input to the worker:

    gearman: gearman_client_run_tasks : connect_poll(Connection refused)
    getsockopt() failed -> libgearman/connection.cc:104

It turns out that it is [a known bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/gearmand/+bug/1047154) that was fixed upstream but still affects Debian wheezy and some versions of Ubuntu.

The bug report is pretty unhelpful since the work-around is hidden away in the comments of this ["invalid" answer](https://answers.launchpad.net/gearmand/+question/196397): be explicit about the hostname and port number in both gearman calls.

So I was able to make it work like this:

    gearman -w -h 127.0.0.1 -p 4730 -f mytest cat    
    echo "hi there" | gearman -h 127.0.0.1 -p 4730 -f mytest

where the hostname matches **exactly** what's in `/etc/default/gearman-job-server`.
