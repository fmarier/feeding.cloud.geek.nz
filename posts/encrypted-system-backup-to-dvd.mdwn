Inspired by [World Backup Day](http://worldbackupday.net/), I decided to take a backup of my laptop. Thanks to using a [free operating system](http://www.debian.org/) I don't have to backup any of my software, just configuration and data files, which fit on a single DVD.  
  
In order to avoid worrying too much about secure storage and disposal of these backups, I have decided to encrypt them using a standard [encrypted loopback filesystem](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/2008/04/two-tier-encryption-strategy-archiving.html).  
  
(Feel free to leave a comment if you can suggest an easier way of doing this.)  
  

### Cryptmount setup

Install [cryptmount](http://cryptmount.sourceforge.net/):  


    apt-get install cryptmount


and setup two encrypted mount points in `/etc/cryptmount/cmtab`:

    backup {
      dev=/backup.dat
      dir=/backup
      fstype=ext4
      mountoptions=defaults,noatime

      keyfile=/backup.key
      keyhash=sha512
      keycipher=aes-xts-plain64
      keyformat=builtin
      cipher=aes-xts-plain64
    }

    testbackup {
      dev=/media/cdrom/backup.dat
      dir=/backup
      fstype=ext4
      mountoptions=defaults,noatime,ro

      keyfile=/media/cdrom/backup.key
      keyhash=sha512
      keycipher=aes-xts-plain64
      keyformat=builtin
      cipher=aes-xts-plain64
    }

### Initialize the encrypted filesystem

Make sure you have at least 4.3 GB of free disk space on `/` and then run:  


    mkdir /backup
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/backup.dat bs=1M count=4096
    cryptmount --generate-key 32 backup
    cryptmount --prepare backup
    mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -O ^metadata_csum /dev/mapper/backup
    cryptmount --release backup

Alternatively, if you're using a double-layer DVD then use this `dd` line:

    dd if=/dev/zero of=/backup.dat bs=1M count=8000


### Burn the data to a DVD

Mount the newly created partition:  


    cryptmount backup


and then copy the files you want to `/backup/` before unmounting that partition:  


    cryptmount -u backup


Finally, use your favourite DVD-burning program to burn these files:

  * `/backup.dat`
  * `/backup.key`
  * `/etc/cryptmount/cmtab`

### Test your backup

Before deleting these two files, test the DVD you've just burned by mounting it:  


    mount /cdrom  
    cryptmount testbackup


and looking at a random sampling of the files contained in `/backup`.  
  
Once you are satisfied that your backup is fine, umount the DVD:  


    cryptmount -u testbackup  
    umount /cdrom


and remove the temporary files:  


    rm /backup.dat /backup.key
