That'll work just fine on `ext2` and `ext3` but fails on `ext4` filesystem with the `flex_bg` feature enabled:

    # tune2fs -I 256 /dev/sda1
    Changing the inode size not supported for filesystems with the flex_bg
    feature enabled.

Also, that flag cannot be cleared:

    # tune2fs -O ^flex_bg /dev/sda1 
    Clearing the flex_bg flag would cause the the filesystem to be
    inconsistent.

So, unless I'm missing something, there's no two ways about it and, as per the post, copy->mkfs->copy is the only way to fix it.

BTW, the same issue will affect _XFS_ and, potentially, other filesystems.
