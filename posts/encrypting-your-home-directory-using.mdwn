Laptops are easily lost or stolen and in order to protect your emails, web passwords, encryption keys, etc., you should really think about encrypting (at least) your home directory.  
  
If you happen to have `/home` on a separate partition already (`/dev/hda5` in this example), then it's a really easy process:  

  1. Copy your home directory to a temporary directory on a different partition:  


        mkdir /homebackup  
        cp -a /home/* /homebackup


  2. Encrypt your home partition:  


        umount /home  
        cryptsetup -h sha256 -c aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 -s 256 luksFormat /dev/hda5  
        cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/hda5 chome  
        mkfs.ext3 -m 0 /dev/mapper/chome


  3. Add this line to `/etc/crypttab`:  


        chome    /dev/hda5    none    luks,timeout=30


  4. Set the home partition to this in `/etc/fstab`:  


        /dev/mapper/chome /home ext3 nodev,nosuid,relatime 0 2


  5. Copy your home data back into the encrypted partition:  


        mount /home  
        cp -a /homebackup/* /home  
        rm -rf /homebackup


That's it. Now to fully secure your laptop against theft, you should think about an [encrypted backup strategy](http://packages.debian.org/sid/duplicity) for your data...
