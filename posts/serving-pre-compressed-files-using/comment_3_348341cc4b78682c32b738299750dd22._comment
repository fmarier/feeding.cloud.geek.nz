@Jan Thanks for catching that. It turns out that the anchor on that link was pointing to the wrong section.  
  
The link should have been:  
  
https://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/caching.html#LeverageBrowserCaching  
  
which says:  
  
"Internet Explorer does not cache any resources that are served with the Vary header and any fields but Accept-Encoding and User-Agent. To ensure these resources are cached by IE, make sure to strip out any other fields from the Vary header, or remove the Vary header altogether if possible."
