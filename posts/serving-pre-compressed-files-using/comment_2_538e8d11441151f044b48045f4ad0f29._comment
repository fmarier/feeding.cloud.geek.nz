Hi Fran√ßois. Great idea!  
  
What happens if you have images inside your CSS directory? As far as I can see, you treat the whole content inside the css/ and js/ directories the same way...  
  
I suppose there's a way to exclude certain files in the Apache configuration, but that's making it a bit more trickier. Next time I'm boosting a web application, I'll be sure to try that out.
