Hello,

i have tried out your solution after failing about the one which did not help you also. 
But seems i am stuck in [this update nightmare](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1256247/ubuntu-20-kernel-upgrade-encrypted-volume-group-cannot-be-found-crypttab-em).

If you have any idea how to solve this i would be very greatful!
