I didn't need to install `lvm2`, as it was on my unbootable system.  I also had some minor partition/volume differences.

My issue is documented at the [Ubuntu forums](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2409754)

That all said, **I did have a major issue with DNS resolution not functioning** after this was done.  I'm wondering if `update-initramfs` lead to this issue specifically (I made other changes I can't recall clearly).

If other experience loss of DNS via systemd.resolved failure, please note it here and on my post in the Ubuntu Forums.  My fix is listed there, although I'm effectively disabling systemd.resolved.
