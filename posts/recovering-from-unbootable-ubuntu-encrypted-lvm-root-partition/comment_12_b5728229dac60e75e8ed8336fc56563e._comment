This is a superb guide, thanks!

I had an additional problem and while running \"update-initramfs -c -k all\" I got the following error:

    cryptsetup: ERROR: Couldn't find sysfs directory for 253:2


Google couldn't answer anything about this error, but I finally figured it out - you just need to mount the sysfs (just like you mounted /proc and /dev). So just run this command:

    mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys

Now when you run update-initramfs again the error should be gone and you can boot to your Linux again!
