Hello - thanks for this info I've had the exact same issue and am now able to boot. Just struggling with the 2nd part of the fix;

# system boots normally
# fixing issue
# edit /etc/crypttab
#rename the first space delimited
# occurrence with sameluksdrivenamethenappend_crypt
# quit n save
# finally run
root@ubuntu# update-initramfs -u -v
# finally reboot
# fixed.

I can't seem to edit the crypttab file to start with, do you know which viewer i should be using? And then is it simply a case of adding the _crypt to the first space delimited occurence?
