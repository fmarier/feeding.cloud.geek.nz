Had a very similar issue after an update of Ubuntu 20.04 on a Dell XPS13 (2020).
Searched for hours, the solution was actually super easy.

1. reboot and go to BIOS using \"fn and F2\"  
2. BIOS > System Configuration > Sata Operation > switch to \"AHCI\" from \"RAID On\"

For some reason, this BIOS setting was switched.
