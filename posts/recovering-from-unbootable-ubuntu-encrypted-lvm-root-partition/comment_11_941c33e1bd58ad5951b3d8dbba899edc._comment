My case was similar, but I had an additional issue. On my Ubuntu machine /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/lvm2 was not set as executable. This caused it to be skipped when initramfs was built, leaving me with an initramfs without LVM. After making the file executable (chmod +x) and rebuilding initramfs, the system was bootable again.
