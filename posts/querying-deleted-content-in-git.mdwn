If you have removed a file (or part of a file) from git, it's not immediately obvious how to query its history. Here are two ways to deal with deleted content in git.  
  

## Commit history of a deleted file

If we take the following two files:  


    $ ls  
    file1  file2


  
and then decide to delete one of them:  


    $ git rm file2  
    rm 'file2'  
    $ git commit -m "Delete a file"  
    [deletefile 87fadb9] Delete a file  
    1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)  
    delete mode 100644 file2


  
To see the commit history of that file, you can't do it the usual way:  


    $ git log file2  
    fatal: ambiguous argument 'file2': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.  
    Use '--' to separate paths from revisions


  
Instead, you need to do this:  


    $ git log -- file2


  

## Finding the commit that deleted a line

Finding the commit that deleted a line is slightly more complicated. Unfortunately, we can't really use `git blame` for that. All we can do with `git blame` is to find the last commit which contained the deleted line.  
  
So if we add the following file:  


    $ cat file3  
    one  
    two  
    three  
    $ git add file3  
    $ git commit -a -m "Add a third file"  
    [master e62ace6] Add a third file  
    1 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)  
    create mode 100644 file3


  
and remove the second line:  


    $ cat file3  
    one  
    three  
    $ git commit -a -m "Remove a line"  
    [removeline f3eb691] Remove a line  
    1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)


  
then we can use `git blame` see what was the last revision to contain each line:  

<pre>
$ git blame --reverse HEAD^..HEAD file3  
f3eb691d (Francois 2010-07-04  1) one  
^<b>e62ace6</b> (Francois 2010-07-04  2) two  
f3eb691d (Francois 2010-07-04  3) three
</pre>

  
Finding the commit that deleted that file requires using `git log` to search for the text contained on that deleted line:  

<pre>
$ git log --oneline -S'<i>two</i>' file3  
<b>f3eb691</b> Remove a line  
e62ace6 Add a third file
</pre>
