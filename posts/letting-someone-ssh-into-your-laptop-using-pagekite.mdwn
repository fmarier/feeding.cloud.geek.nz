In order to [investigate a bug I was running into](https://github.com/mozilla/rr/issues/1537), I recently had to give
[my colleague](http://robert.ocallahan.org/) ssh access to my laptop behind a firewall. The easiest way
I found to do this was to create an account for him on my laptop, and setup a
[pagekite](https://pagekite.net/wiki/OpenSource/) frontend on my personal server
and a pagekite backend on my laptop.

# Frontend setup

Setting up my server in order to make the ssh service accessible and
proxy the traffic to my laptop was fairly straightforward.

First, I had to install the
[pagekite package](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/pagekite) (already in
Debian and Ubuntu) and open up a port on my firewall by adding the following
to both `/etc/network/iptables.up.rules` and
`/etc/network/ip6tables.up.rules`:

    -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 10022 -j ACCEPT

Then I created a new `CNAME` for my server in DNS:

    pagekite.fmarier.org.	3600	IN	CNAME	fmarier.org.

With that in place, I started the pagekite frontend using this command:

    pagekite --clean --isfrontend --rawports=virtual --ports=10022 --domain=raw:pagekite.fmarier.org:Password1

# Backend setup

After installing the [pagekite](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/pagekite) and
[openssh-server](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/openssh-server) packages
on my laptop and creating a new user account:

    adduser roc

I used this command to connect my laptop to the pagekite frontend:

    pagekite --clean --frontend=pagekite.fmarier.org:10022 --service_on=raw/22:pagekite.fmarier.org:localhost:22:Password1

# Client setup

Finally, my colleague needed to add the folowing entry to `~/.ssh/config`:

    Host pagekite.fmarier.org
      CheckHostIP no
      ProxyCommand /bin/nc -X connect -x %h:10022 %h %p

and install the
[netcat-openbsd](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/netcat-openbsd) package
since [other versions of netcat don't work](https://pagekite.net/wiki/Howto/SshOverPageKite/#wrongnetcat).

On Fedora, we used
[netcat-openbsd-1.89](http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/23693452/dir/fedora_19/com/netcat-openbsd-1.89-119.1.i686.rpm.html)
successfully, but
[this newer package](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?project=home%3Astefjakobs&package=netcat-openbsd)
may also work.

He was then able to ssh into my laptop via `ssh roc@pagekite.fmarier.org`.

# Making settings permanent

I was initially quite happy settings things up temporarily on the
command-line, but it's also possible to persist these settings and to make
both the pagekite
[frontend and backend start up automatically](https://pagekite.net/wiki/Howto/GNULinux/ConfigureYourSystem/))
at boot.

I ended up putting the following in `/etc/pagekite.d/20_frontends.rc` on my
server:

    #defaults
    
    isfrontend
    rawports=virtual
    ports=10022
    domain=raw:pagekite.fmarier.org:Password1

as well as removing the following lines from `/etc/pagekite.d/10_account.rc`:

    # Delete this line!
    abort_not_configured

before restarting the pagekite daemon using:

    systemctl restart pagekite

# Using mosh and pagekite

[Mosh](https://mosh.org/) is a nice way to interface with ssh over
high-latency netowrks. However, it's not possible to tunnel mosh directly
through pagekited since [pagekite only supports
TCP](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/pagekite-discuss/YUfhVfWyYsU/discussion).

I ended up with a hybrid setup where I don't have to expose the ssh service
to the local network (and therefore remember to disable it when I'm done)
but I do have to open a UDP port on my firewall for mosh.

First, I assigned a stable IP to my laptop on my router, based on its MAC
address. I also had to disable [MAC address spoofing in Network Manager](https://blogs.gnome.org/thaller/2016/08/26/mac-address-spoofing-in-networkmanager-1-4-0/) (setting it to permanent).

This is what my `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Ethernet automatique` config looks like:

    [ethernet]
    cloned-mac-address=preserve
    
    [ipv4]
    method=auto
    
    [ipv6]
    addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy
    ip6-privacy=2
    method=auto

Then I forwarded port 9000 (UDP) traffic to the static IP address above.
