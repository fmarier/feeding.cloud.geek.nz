[HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Security/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)
is a simple mechanism that secure sites can use to protect their users
against an [sslstrip](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/)-style
HTTPS-to-HTTP downgrade attack.

# Typical attack

The typical HTTPS-to-HTTP downgrade attack looks like this:

1. victim connects to a compromised wifi access point
2. victim connects to bank.com using attacker's DNS resolver
3. attacker directs victim to a local server proxying the bank.com homepage
4. victim clicks on "online banking" link as usual not noticing that it's an
HTTP link instead of the usual HTTPS link
5. attacker mounts a
[man-in-the-middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)
attack over that HTTP online banking login page
6. victim leaks credentials to attacker

You can watch a [short video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1hnHbBb_bA) of this attack, but if you don't want to set any of this up on your server, it turns out you can buy a [little USB device](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple) that [does it all for you](http://hakinthebox.blogspot.co.nz/2012/06/you-just-cant-trust-wireless-covertly.html).

# What HSTS does

The fix is simple: let the browser know that it should never connect to the
online banking site over plain HTTP. It should automatically upgrade to an
encrypted HTTPS connection.

How should a site let the browser know? By including an HTTP header in its
responses:

    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=10886400

It works in Chrome, Firefox and Opera. Other browsers don't benefit from
this protection, but it also doesn't interfere with anything on those other
browsers. So anybody with an HTTPS-only site should make use of this.

# How many banks use it?

Given how easy it is to implement (and the fact that it's been in
browsers since Chrome 4 and Firefox 4), how many of the Australasian banks
actually make use of it? After all, almost all of the documentation
explaining the motivation behind HSTS uses online banking as an example.

Here are all of the New Zealand banks I tested:

## Conclusion

So, well done ASB! Not only do you stand out from your peers, but you also
allowed New Zealand to beat Australia in terms of HSTS coverage :)

Here's the script I used to generate these results:
