 subject="Get &quot;partition table exists&quot; and other warning when trying to create mdadm"

I've followed the instructions, but when it comes to the \"mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-disks=2 missing /dev/sdh1\" command, I get:

mdadm: partition table exists on /dev/sdh1

mdadm: partition table exists on /dev/sdh1 but will be lost or
       meaningless after creating array

mdadm: Note: this array has metadata at the start and
    may not be suitable as a boot device.  If you plan to
    store '/boot' on this device please ensure that
    your boot-loader understands md/v1.x metadata, or use
    --metadata=0.90

Continue creating array? 

...I answer no at that point, but what should I do? 

My OS is AlmaLinux, but I would think the instructions would apply. It uses an LVM partition system, but other instructions I've found that include LVM have the same steps.

Thanks for any help.
