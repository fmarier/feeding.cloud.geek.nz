I've follow this tutorial, everything went OK but grub. This part was difficult because of two reasons: 
1) I use the GPT and the error was that boot partition doesn't have the bios_grub flag - don't forget to assign when create partitions on the new disk  
2) the new 16.04 system has different raid modules to be loaded at grub start like dm_raid, megaraid etc. This part should be updated.
