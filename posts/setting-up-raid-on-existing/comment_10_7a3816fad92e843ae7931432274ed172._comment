On ubuntu 12.04:  
...This should cause the init ramdisk (/boot/initrd.img-2.6.32-5-amd64) and the grub menu (/boot/grub/grub.cfg) to be rebuilt with RAID support....  
  
IT DOES NOT.  
  
Helped me with some steps from the older manual http://wiki.xtronics.com/index.php/Raid  
  
\# mount -o bind /dev /tmp/mntroot/dev   
\# mount -t proc none /tmp/mntroot/proc   
\# mount -t sysfs none /tmp/mntroot/sys  
\# chroot /mntroot  
\# /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf > /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf  
\# update-initramfs -u -k all  
\# update-grub  
  
updated /etc/fstab with the new UUID's (blkid /dev/md0) and installed grub first only on the raid disc (sdb) with  
\# grub-install /dev/sdb  
  
Disconected the old disc (sda), the system booted from the degraded raid array.  
  
Hope it helps someone.
