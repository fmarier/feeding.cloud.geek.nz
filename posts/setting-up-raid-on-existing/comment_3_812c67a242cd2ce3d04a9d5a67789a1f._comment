Hello, thanks for this entry. I too run raid1 on all my Debian systems so I'll add comments from my experience:  
_If you don't set the metadata to 0.90 during raid creation you'd be better of with 1.* (I use 1.2), then using "fd" as filesystem type isn't needed anymore. All my systems run with 1.2 metadata and boot just fine without "fd" as file-system type.  
_If you want to have "md0" "non-partitionable" (not really) raid devices you could set --auto=md to avoid messing things up if you assemble raid arrays on another system (recovery, ...etc).  
_Lastly using the --homehost and --name bits to identify the raid devices is coming in handy when juggling with many devices and switching systems. Easier to use than the array's UUID.  
  
All the best.
