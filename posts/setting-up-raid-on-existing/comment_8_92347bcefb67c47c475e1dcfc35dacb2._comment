Great guide, specially about how you play it safe, and fail check end the end.  
  
  
But I had to supplement it with this guide: http://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-set-up-software-raid1-on-a-running-system-incl-grub2-configuration-ubuntu-10.04-p1  
  
  
And I can add that, its also possible to make mdadm daemon send email about any fails if the happens. A nice warning system.
