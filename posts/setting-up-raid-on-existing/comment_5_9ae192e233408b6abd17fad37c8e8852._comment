I was having a bear of a time getting step 5 to work. (Kernel panics and/or /dev/md0 missing on boot and subsequently being dumped to the initramfs prompt.)   
  
Turned out that step 4 was doing nothing raid related for me. Which I solved with the following 2 steps.  
  
1) Kept the initrd generated during "dpkg-reconfigure mdadm".  
  
2) "grub-install --modules='raid proc_msdos ext2'" to both drives so grub could find md0. (substituting proc_msdos and ext2 with current insmod entries in you grub's menu items)
