Awesome tutorial, thank you. I used this to migrate an old Ubuntu 10.04 system with minor changes:  
  
- Stick with metadata 0.90 I had problems with using 1.2  
- I didn't bother using partition type FD, I just flagged the ext4 partition as a RAID partition using gparted.  
- Install grub-pc first, I was using grub1 on my old machine  
- Had to fix a MAKEDEV bug  
ln -s /sbin/MAKEDEV /dev/MAKEDEV  
- Reconfiguring mdadm to boot degraded disks is important for the tests.
