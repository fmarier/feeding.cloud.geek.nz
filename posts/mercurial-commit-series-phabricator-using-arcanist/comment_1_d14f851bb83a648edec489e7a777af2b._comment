I think you're missing one useful part to commit series updates.

It is unclear if you let it prompt you for the commit messages & data when you upload, but if you do, then you can follow this slightly easier process.

* upload first patch with `arc diff`, set the reviewer and bug number.
* Note the \"Dnnnn\" number.
* upload the second patch, again with `arc diff`. Also set the reviewer and bug number, but this time add to the summary \"Depends on Dnnnn\" (where Dnnnn is the id of the previous patch).

Then you can avoid linking the commits in the phabricator UI.

Also when you then need to update a diff, you can simply do `arc diff` to generate the new version as it already knows what it depends on.
