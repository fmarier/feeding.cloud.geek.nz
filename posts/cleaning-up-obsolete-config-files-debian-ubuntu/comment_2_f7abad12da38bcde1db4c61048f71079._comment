I found that on my system all cases when your rm-and-reinstall procedure failed to clear the file off the obsolete list was exactly because of what you suspectedâ€”some other package than the one given by `dpkg -S` had installed the file in the first place.  So for the record, `dpkg -W` can tell you which package to look for:

    dpkg-query -W '-f=${Package}\n${Conffiles}\n' | awk '/^[^ ]/{pkg=$1}/ obsolete$/{print pkg,$0}'
