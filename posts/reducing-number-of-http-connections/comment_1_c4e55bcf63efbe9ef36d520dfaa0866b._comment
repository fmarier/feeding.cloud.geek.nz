Good article. On the new www.DoC.govt.nz we used CSS sprites (for most icons and gradients), we minified and aggregated JavaScript and CSS (so that @import statements were resolved and multiple link/script tags were combined where possible). I think they're getting to the easier stuff like http gzip soon.
