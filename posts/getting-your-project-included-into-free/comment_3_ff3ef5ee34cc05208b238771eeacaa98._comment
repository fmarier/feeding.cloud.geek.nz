For Arch, the packaging step is very simple, and comprises just making a [PKGBUILD](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD) which has a build() function to build the package. Once a PKGBUILD has been made, it can be submitted to AUR ([http://aur.archlinux.org](http://aur.archlinux.org)). If it gets enough votes (or a trusted user aka TU likes it), it'll be adopted and moved to the [community] binary repository.
