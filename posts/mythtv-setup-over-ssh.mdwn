In order to configure a remote [MythTV](https://www.mythtv.org/) server, I
had to run `mythtv-setup` remotely over an ssh connection with X forwarding:

    ssh -X mythtv@machine

For most config options, I can either use the configuration menus inside of
of `mythfrontend` (over a [vnc
connection](/posts/high-latency-vnc-tech-support/))
or the *Settings* section of
[MythWeb](https://www.mythtv.org/detail/mythweb), but some of the backend
and tuner settings are only available through the main setup program.

Unfortunately, `mythtv-setup` won't work over an ssh connection by default
and prints the following error in the terminal:

    $ mythtv-setup
    ...
    W  OpenGL: Could not determine whether Sync to VBlank is enabled.
    Handling Segmentation fault
    Segmentation fault (core dumped)

The fix for this was to specify a different theme engine:

    mythtv-setup -O ThemePainter=qt

[[!tag mythtv]]
