As part of debugging an upstream connection problem I've been seeing
recently, I wanted to be able to monitor the logs from my [Turris
Omnia](https://www.turris.com/en/omnia/overview/) router. Here's how I
configured it to send its logs to a server I already had on the local
network.

## Server setup

The first thing I did was to open up my server's
[rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/) (Debian's default syslog server) to
remote connections since it's going to be the destination host for the
router's log messages.

I added the following to `/etc/rsyslog.d/router.conf`:

    module(load="imtcp")
    input(type="imtcp" port="514")
    
    if $fromhost-ip == '192.168.1.1' then {
        if $syslogseverity <= 5 then {
            action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/router.log")
        }
        stop
    }

This is using the latest rsyslog configuration method: a handy scripting
language called
[RainerScript](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/rainerscript/index.html).
[Severity level](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rsyslog#Severity_levels) 5
maps to "notice" which consists of *unusual non-error conditions*, and
`192.168.1.1` is of course the IP address of the router on the LAN side.
With this, I'm directing all router log messages to a separate file,
filtering out anything less important than severity 5.

In order for rsyslog to pick up this new configuration file, I restarted it:

    systemctl restart rsyslog.service

and checked that it was running correctly (e.g. no syntax errors in the new
config file) using:

    systemctl status rsyslog.service

Since I added a new log file, I also setup log rotation for it by putting
the following in `/etc/logrotate.d/router`:

    /var/log/router.log
    {
        rotate 4
        weekly
        missingok
        notifempty
        compress
        delaycompress
        sharedscripts
        postrotate
            /usr/lib/rsyslog/rsyslog-rotate
        endscript
    }

In addition, since I use
[logcheck](https://packages.debian.org/stable/logcheck) to monitor my server
logs and email me errors, I had to add `/var/log/router.log` to
`/etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles`.

Finally I opened the rsyslog port to the router in my server's firewall by
adding the following to `/etc/network/iptables.up.rules`:

    # Allow logs from the router
    -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.1 -p tcp --dport 514 -j ACCEPT

and ran `iptables-apply`.

With all of this in place, it was time to get the router to send messages.

## Router setup

As [suggested on the Turris
forum](https://forum.turris.cz/t/remote-log-how-to-configure/992/3), I
ssh'ed into my router and added this in `/etc/syslog-ng.d/remote.conf`:

    destination d_loghost {
            network("192.168.1.200" time-zone("America/Vancouver"));
    };
    
    source dns {
            file("/var/log/resolver");
    };
    
    log {
            source(src);
            source(net);
            source(kernel);
            source(dns);
            destination(d_loghost);
    };

Setting the [timezone](https://www.syslog-ng.com/technical-documents/doc/syslog-ng-open-source-edition/3.33/administration-guide/time-zone) to the same as my server was needed because the router
messages were otherwise sent with UTC timestamps.

To ensure that the destination host always gets the same IP address
(`192.168.1.200`), I went to the [advanced DHCP configuration
page](https://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/network/dhcp) and added a
*static lease* for the server's MAC address so that it always gets assigned
`192.168.1.200`. If that wasn't already the server's IP address, you'll have
to restart it for this to take effect.

Finally, I restarted the syslog-ng daemon on the router to pick up the new
config file:

    /etc/init.d/syslog-ng restart

## Testing

In order to test this configuration, I opened three terminal windows:

1. `tail -f /var/log/syslog` on the server
2. `tail -f /var/log/router.log` on the server
3. `tail -f /var/log/messages` on the router

I immediately started to see messages from the router in the third window
and some of these, not all because of my severity-5 filter, were flowing to
the second window as well. Also important is that none of the messages make
it to the first window, otherwise log messages from the router would be mixed
in with the server's own logs. That's the purpose of the `stop` command in
`/etc/rsyslog.d/router.conf`.

To force a log messages to be emitted by the router, simply ssh into it and
issue the following command:

    logger Test

It should show up in the second and third windows immediately if you've got
everything setup correctly

## Timezone problems

If I do the following on my router:

  /etc/init.d/syslog-ng restart
  logger TestA

I see the following in `/var/log/messages`:

  Aug 14 20:39:35 hostname syslog-ng[9860]: syslog-ng shutting down; version='3.37.1'
  Aug 14 20:39:36 hostname syslog-ng[10024]: syslog-ng starting up; version='3.37.1'
  Aug 15 03:39:49 hostname root: TestA

The correct timezone is the one in the first two lines. Other daemon
messages are displayed using an incorrect timezone like `logger`.

Thanks to a [very helpful `syslog-ng` mailing list thread](https://lists.balabit.hu/pipermail/syslog-ng/2022-August/thread.html#26509), I found that this is actually an [upstream OpenWRT bug](https://gitlab.nic.cz/turris/os/packages/-/issues/471).

My favourite work-around is to tell syslog-ng to simply ignore the timestamp
provided by the application and to use the time of reception (of the log
message) instead. To do this, simply change the following in
`/etc/syslog-ng.conf`:

    source src {
        internal();
        unix-dgram("/dev/log");
    };

to:

    source src {
        internal();
        unix-dgram("/dev/log", keep-timestamp(no));
    };
