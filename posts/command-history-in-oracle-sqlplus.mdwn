[Readline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readline)-style editing (arrow keys, word deletion, command history, etc.) is a feature that most users expect out of a command-line application on Linux. And one that is painfully missing from Oracle sqlplus (the equivalent to psql).  
  
Of course, Debian has a solution:  

    apt-get install rlwrap
    rlwrap sqlplus
  
You may also find it useful if, for some reason, you need to use the [dash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Almquist_shell) shell interactively.
