Now that we live in a post-[Firesheep](http://codebutler.com/firesheep?c=1) World, I tend to default to https unless I'm building a public website without logins. (And according to Google, the overhead of running SSL is [much lower](http://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html) than people think.)  
  
While Gerrit does look a bit big, I found that it's actually quite useful, even in a very small team.
