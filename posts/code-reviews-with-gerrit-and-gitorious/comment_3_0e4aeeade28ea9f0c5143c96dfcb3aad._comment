Hi, First of all thanks for this info.  This is very helpful to start gerrit setup. I completed my gerrit setup based on this, but I wonder how to create GerritSiteHeader.html and GerritSiteFooter.html files. 
Do you have any sample format for these files so that I can just change color/logo/names etc. 

Thanks
Sridhar
