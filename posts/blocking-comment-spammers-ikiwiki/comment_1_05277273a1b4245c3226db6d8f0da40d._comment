Very interesting, thanks. This is an approach I had not yet considered. I likewise get a low level of spam on my IkiWiki site; too low for me to have done much about improving the tools to handle it. But the tools could be a lot better.  If you do look at this any further, just to say that IkiWiki would be open to improvements at its layer.
