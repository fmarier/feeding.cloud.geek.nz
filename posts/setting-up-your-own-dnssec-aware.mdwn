Now that the root DNS servers are [signed,](http://www.root-dnssec.org/2010/07/16/status-update-2010-07-16/) I thought it was time I started using [DNSSEC](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Dnssec) on my own PC. However, not wanting to wait for my ISP to enable it, I decided to setup a private recursive DNS resolver for myself using [Unbound](http://unbound.net/).  
  

## Installing Unbound

Being already packaged in [Debian](http://packages.debian.org/source/unstable/unbound) and [Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unbound), unbound is only an `apt-get` away:


    apt-get install unbound

## Optional settings

In `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/francois.conf`, I enabled the following security options:

    harden-below-nxdomain: yes
    harden-referral-path: yes
    harden-algo-downgrade: no # false positives with improperly configured zones
    use-caps-for-id: no # makes lots of queries fail
    hide-identity: yes
    hide-version: yes

and turned on prefetching to hopefully keep in cache the sites I visit regularly:


    prefetch: yes
    prefetch-key: yes
    msg-cache-size: 128k
    msg-cache-slabs: 2
    rrset-cache-size: 8m
    rrset-cache-slabs: 2
    key-cache-size: 32m
    key-cache-slabs: 2
    cache-min-ttl: 3600
    num-threads: 2

Finally, I also enabled the control interface:

    control-enable: yes
    control-interface: 127.0.0.1

and increased the amount of debugging information:

    val-log-level: 2
    use-syslog: yes
    verbosity: 1

before running `sudo unbound-control-setup` to generate the necessary keys.
  
Once unbound is restarted (`sudo service unbound restart`) stats can be queried to make sure that the DNS resolver is working:


    unbound-control stats
  

## Overriding DHCP settings

In order to use my own unbound server for DNS lookups and not the one received via [DHCP](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Dhcp), I added this line to `/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf`:


    supersede domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;


and restarted dhclient:


    sudo killall dhclient
    sudo killall dhclient
    sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart


If you're not using DHCP, then you simply need to put this in your `/etc/resolv.conf`:


    nameserver 127.0.0.1
  

## Testing DNSSEC resolution

Once everything is configured properly, the best way I found to test that this setup was actually working is to use a web browser to visit these sites:

  * [http://www.dnssec.cz/](http://www.dnssec.cz/) should show a green key
  * [http://www.rhybar.cz/](http://www.rhybar.cz/) should not be reachable

and using dig:

```
$ dig +dnssec A www.dnssec.cz | grep ad  
;; flags: qr rd ra <b>ad</b>; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 3, ADDITIONAL: 1
```
  
Are there any other ways of making sure that DNSSEC is fully functional?
