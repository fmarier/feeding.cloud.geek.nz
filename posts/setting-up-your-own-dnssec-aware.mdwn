Now that the root DNS servers are [signed,](http://www.root-dnssec.org/2010/07/16/status-update-2010-07-16/) I thought it was time I started using [DNSSEC](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Dnssec) on my own PC. However, not wanting to wait for my ISP to enable it, I decided to setup a private recursive DNS resolver for myself using [Unbound](http://unbound.net/).  
  

## Installing Unbound

Being already packaged in [Debian](http://packages.debian.org/source/unstable/unbound) and [Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unbound), unbound is only an apt-get away:  


    apt-get install unbound


though if you are running [lenny](http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/), I suggest you grab the latest [backport](http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/).  
  
Once unbound is installed, follow [these instructions](http://www.unbound.net/documentation/howto_anchor.html) to enable DNSSEC.  
  

## Optional settings

In my `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf`, I enabled the following security options:  


    harden-referral-path: yes  
    use-caps-for-id: yes


and turned on prefetching to hopefully keep in cache the sites I visit regularly:  


    prefetch: yes  
    prefetch-key: yes


Finally, I also enabled statistics:  


    extended-statistics: yes  
    control-enable: yes  
    control-interface: 127.0.0.1


and ran `sudo unbound-control-setup` to generate the necessary keys.  
  
Once unbound is restarted (`sudo /etc/init.d/unbound restart`) stats can be queried to make sure that the DNS resolver is working:  


    unbound-control stats


  

## Overriding DHCP settings

In order to use my own unbound server for DNS lookups and not the one received via [DHCP](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Dhcp), I added this line to `/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf`:  


    supersede domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;


and restarted dhclient:  


    sudo killall dhclient  
    sudo killall dhclient  
    sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart


If you're not using DHCP, then you simply need to put this in your `/etc/resolv.conf`:  


    nameserver 127.0.0.1


  

## Testing DNSSEC resolution

Once everything is configured properly, the best way I found to test that this setup was actually working is to use a web browser to visit these sites:  

  * [http://www.dnssec.cz/](http://www.dnssec.cz/) should show a green key
  * [http://www.rhybar.cz/](http://www.rhybar.cz/) should not be reachable

and using dig:  

<pre>
$ dig +dnssec A www.dnssec.cz | grep ad  
;; flags: qr rd ra <b>ad</b>; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 3, ADDITIONAL: 1
</pre>

  
Are there any other ways of making sure that DNSSEC is fully functional?
