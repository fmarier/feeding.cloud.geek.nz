[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/) has a really neat feature which consists of
*time-stretching* audio to allow users to speed up or slow video playback
with the `[` and `]` keys without affecting the pitch of the sound. I
recently [switched to Kodi](/posts/creating-kodi-media-pc-raspberry-pi/) as
my video player of choice and I was looking for the equivalent feature.

## Kodi equivalent

To enable this feature in Kodi, you first need to enable *[Sync playback to
display](https://kodi.wiki/view/Settings/Player/Videos#Sync_playback_to_display)*
in `Settings | Player | Videos`.

Then map the [`tempoup` and `tempodown`
commands](https://kodi.wiki/view/List_of_built-in_functions#Player_built-in.27s)
to the [same keyboard
shorcuts as VLC](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=10023&pid=2447300#pid2447300).

In my case however, I wanted to map these functions to buttons on my [Streamzap
remote](/posts/using-streamzap-remote-with-kodi/)
and so I put the following in my `~/.kodi/userdata/keymaps/remote.xml`:

      <FullscreenVideo>
        <remote>
          <pageminus>PlayerControl(tempodown)</pageminus>
          <pageplus>PlayerControl(tempoup)</pageplus>
        </remote>
      </FullscreenVideo>

which allows me to press the `Ch +` and `Ch -` buttons on the remote to
adjust the speed while the video is playing (in full-screen mode only, not
with the menu displayed).

## Examples

Here are three ways I use this functionality:

- I set it to `0.9x` for movies in languages I'm not totally proficient in.
- I set it to `1.1x` for almost everything since the difference is not
  especially perceptible, but it still allows me to watch 10% more movies in
  the same amount of time :)
- I set it to `1.2x` for [Rick &
  Morty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty) because it makes
  [Rick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Sanchez) even more hilariously
  reckless and impatient.

Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to **set the default tempo value**. The
closest setting I could find is the one which allows you to set the maximum
tempo value [`maxtempo`](https://kodi.wiki/view/Advancedsettings.xml#video).
If you know of a way, please leave a comment!
