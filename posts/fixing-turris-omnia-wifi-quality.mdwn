I was recently hoping to replace an aging proprietary router (upgraded to a
[Gargoyle](https://www.gargoyle-router.com/) FOSS firmware). After rejecting
a [popular brand with a disturbing GPL violation
habit](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2019/oct/02/cambium-ubiquiti-gpl-violations/),
I settled on the [Turris Omnia router](https://www.turris.cz/en/omnia/),
built on free software. Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the fact that
it is free and comes with automatic updates, but I noticed a problem with
the WiFi. Specifically, the 5 GHz access point was okay but the 2.4 GHz was
awful.

## False lead

I initially thought that the 2.4 GHz radio wasn't working, but then I
realized that putting my phone next to the router would allow it to connect
and exchange data at a slow-but-steady rate. If I moved the phone more than
3-4 meters away though, it would disconnect for lack of signal. To be frank,
the wireless performance was much worse than my original router, even though
the wired performance was, as expected, amazing:

I looked on the [official support forums](https://forum.turris.cz/) and found this intriguing
thread about [interference between USB3 and 2.4 GHz
radios](https://forum.turris.cz/t/slow-wifi-and-bad-signal-finally-solved/7372).
This sounded a lot like what I was experiencing (working radio but terrible
signal/interference) and so I decided to see if I could move the radios
around inside the unit, as suggested by the poster.

After opening the case however, I noticed that radios were already laid out
in the optimal way:

and that USB3 interference wasn't going to be the reason
for my troubles.

## Real problem

So I took a good look at the wiring and found that while the the [larger
radio](https://compex.com.sg/shop/wifi-module/802-11ac-wave-1/wle900vx/)
(2.4 / 5 GHz dual-bander) was connected to all three antennas, the [smaller
radio](https://compex.com.sg/shop/wifi-module/802-11n/wle200n2/) (2.4 GHz
only) was connected to only 2 of the 3 antennas:

To make it possible for antennas 1 and 3 to carry the signal from both
radios, a duplexer got inserted between the radios and the antenna:

On one side is the 2.4 antenna port and on the other side is the 5 GHz port.

Looking at the wiring though, it became clear that **my 2.4 GHz radio was
connected to the 5 GHz ports of the two duplexers and the 5 GHz radio was
connected to the 2.4 GHz ports of the duplexers**. This makes sense
considering that I had okay 5 GHz performance (with one of the three chains
connected to the right filter) and abysimal 2.4 GHz performance (with none
of the two chains connected to the right filter).

## Solution

**Swapping the antenna connectors around completely fixed the problem.**
With the 2.4 GHz radio connected to the 2.4 side of the duplexer and the
dual-bander connected to the 5 GHz side, I was able to get the performance I
would expect from such a high-quality router.

Interestingly enough, I found the solution to this problem the same weekend
as I passed my advanced [amateur radio license
exam](https://launchpad.net/canadian-ham-exam). I guess that was a good way
to put the course material into practice!
