Using a
[Virtual Private Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)
is a good way to work-around
[geoIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation) restrictions but also to
protect your network traffic when travelling with your laptop and connecting
to untrusted networks.

While you might want to
[use Tor](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/things-that-work-well-with-tor/)
for the part of your network activity where you prefer to be anonymous, a
VPN is a faster way to connect to sites that already know you.

Here are my instructions for setting up [OpenVPN](http://openvpn.net/) on
Debian / Ubuntu machines where the VPN server is located on a cheap
[Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=4f882417aa3809652b227d6d9c25b2a0472c6cff)
virtual private server. They are largely based on the
[instructions found on the Debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/openvpn%20for%20server%20and%20client).

An easier way to setup an ad-hoc VPN is to use
[sshuttle](https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle) but for some reason, it
doesn't seem work on Linode or Rackspace virtual servers.

# Generating the keys

Make sure you run the following on a machine with good entropy and not a VM!
I personally use a machine fitted with an
[Entropy Key](http://www.entropykey.co.uk/).

The first step is to install the required package:

    sudo apt-get install openvpn

Then, copy the following file in your home directory (no need to run any of
this as root):

    mkdir easy-rsa
    cp -ai /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0/ easy-rsa/
    cd easy-rsa/2.0

and put something like this in your `~/easy-rsa/2.0/vars`:

    export KEY_SIZE=2084
    export KEY_COUNTRY="NZ"
    export KEY_PROVINCE="AKL"
    export KEY_CITY="Auckland"
    export KEY_ORG="fmarier.org"
    export KEY_EMAIL="francois@fmarier.org"
    export KEY_CN=hafnarfjordur.fmarier.org
    export KEY_NAME=hafnarfjordur.fmarier.org
    export KEY_OU=VPN

Create this symbolic link:

    ln -s openssl-1.0.0.cnf openssl.cnf in my "2.0" directory

and generate the keys:

    . ./vars
    ./clean-all
    ./build-ca
    ./build-key-server server  # ENTER at every prompt, no password
    ./build-key akranes  # "akranes" as Name, no password
    ./build-dh
    /usr/sbin/openvpn --genkey --secret keys/ta.key

# Configuring the server

On my server, a
[Linode VPS](https://www.linode.com/?r=4f882417aa3809652b227d6d9c25b2a0472c6cff)
called `hafnarfjordur.fmarier.org`, I installed the
[openvpn package](http://packages.debian.org/stable/openvpn):

    apt-get install openvpn

and then copied the following files from my high-entropy machine:

    cp ca.crt dh2048.pem server.key server.crt ta.key /etc/openvpn/
    chown root:root /etc/openvpn/*
    chmod 600 /etc/openvpn/ta.key /etc/openvpn/server.key

Then I took the official configuration template:

    cp /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/server.conf.gz /etc/openvpn/
    gunzip /etc/openvpn/server.conf.gz

and set the following in `/etc/openvpn/server.conf`:

    dh dh2048.pem
    push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"
    push "dhcp-option DNS 74.207.241.5"
    push "dhcp-option DNS 74.207.242.5"
    tls-auth ta.key 0
    cipher AES-128-CBC
    user nobody
    group nogroup

(These DNS servers are the ones I found in `/etc/resolv.conf` on my Linode VPS.)

Finally, I added the following to these configuration files:

* `/etc/sysctl.conf`: `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`
* `/etc/rc.local`: `iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j
  MASQUERADE` (just before `exit 0`)
* `/etc/default/openvpn`: `AUTOSTART="all"`

and ran `sysctl -p` before starting openvpn:

    /etc/init.d/openvpn start

# Configuring the client

The final piece of this solution is to setup my laptop, `akranes`, to
connect to `hafnarfjordur` by installing the relevant
[Network Manager](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager/) plugin:

    apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome

The laptop needs these files from the high-entropy machine:

    cp ca.crt akranes.crt akranes.key ta.key /etc/openvpn/
    chown root:francois /etc/openvpn/akranes.key /etc/openvpn/ta.key
    chmod 640 /etc/openvpn/ta.key /etc/openvpn/akranes.key

and my own user needs to have read access to the secret keys.

To create a new VPN, right-click on Network-Manager and add a new VPN
connection of type "OpenVPN":

* Gateway: `hafnarfjordur.fmarier.org`
* Type: `Certificates (TLS)`
* User Certificate: `/etc/openvpn/akranes.crt`
* CA Certificate: `/etc/openvpn/ca.crt`
* Private Key: `/etc/openvpn/akranes.key`
* Available to all users: `NO`

then click the "Avanced" button and set the following:

* General

 * Use LZO data compression: `YES`

* Security

 * Cipher: `AES-128-CBC`
 * HMAC Authentication: `Default`

* TLS Authentication:

 * Subject Match: `server`
 * Verify peer (server) certificate usage signature: `YES`
 * Remote peer certificate TLS type: `Server`
 * Use additional TLS authentication: `YES`
 * Key File: `/etc/openvpn/ta.key`
 * Key Direction: `1`

# Debugging

If you run into problems, simply take a look at the logs while attempting to
connect to the server:

    tail -f /var/log/syslog

on both the server and the client.

In my experience, searching for the error messages you find in there is
usually enough to solve the problem.

# Next steps

The next thing I'm going to add to this VPN setup is a
[local unbound DNS resolver](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/setting-up-your-own-dnssec-aware/)
that will be offered to all clients.

Is there anything else you have in your setup and that I should consider
adding to mine?
