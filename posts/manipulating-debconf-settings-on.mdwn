It's not very easy to find information on how to adjust [debconf](http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/debconf/) settings after a package has been installed and configured. Most of the information out there is for Debian developers wanting to add [support for debconf](http://www.fifi.org/doc/debconf-doc/tutorial.html) in their [maintainer scripts](http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-maintainerscripts.html).  
  
I ran into the problem of being unable to change a package's configuration options through [dpkg-reconfigure](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dpkg-reconfigure) and I found the following commands to do it manually:  
  

<pre>
debconf-show <i>packagename</i>
</pre>

  
to show the list of debconf values that a package has stored,  
  

<pre>
echo "get <i>packagename</i>/pgsql/app-pass" | debconf-communicate
</pre>

  
to query the current value of an option in the debconf database, and  
  

<pre>
echo "set <i>packagename</i>/pgsql/app-pass password1" | debconf-communicate
</pre>

  
to change that value.  
  
I'm not convinced that this is the easiest way for system administrators to manually lookup and modify debconf options, but that's the best I could find at the time.
