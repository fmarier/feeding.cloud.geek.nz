A laptop that was installed using the default Ubuntu 16.10 (xenial)
[full-disk encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/privacy-ubuntu-1210-full-disk-encryption)
option stopped booting after receiving a
kernel update somewhere on the way to Ubuntu 17.04 (zesty).

After showing the boot screen for about 30 seconds, a busybox shell pops up:

    BusyBox v.1.21.1 (Ubuntu 1:1.21.1-1ubuntu1) built-in shell (ash)
    Enter 'help' for list of built-in commands.
    
    (initramfs)

Typing `exit` will display more information about the failure before
bringing us back to the same busybox shell:

    Gave up waiting for root device. Common problems:
      - Boot args (cat /proc/cmdline)
        - Check rootdelay= (did the system wait long enough?)
        - Check root= (did the system wait for the right device?)
      - Missing modules (cat /proc/modules; ls /dev)
    ALERT! /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root does not exist. Dropping to a shell! 
    
    BusyBox v.1.21.1 (Ubuntu 1:1.21.1-1ubuntu1) built-in shell (ash)   
    Enter 'help' for list of built-in commands.  
    
    (initramfs)

which now complains that the `/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root` root partition
(which uses
[LUKS](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/blob/master/README.md) and
[LVM](https://www.sourceware.org/lvm2/)) cannot be found.

There is some [comprehensive advice out there](https://askubuntu.com/questions/567730/gave-up-waiting-for-root-device-ubuntu-vg-root-doesnt-exist#567897)
but it didn't quite work for me. This is how I ended up resolving the problem.

# Boot using a USB installation disk

First, create bootable USB disk using the latest Ubuntu installer:

1. [Download an desktop image](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
2. Copy the ISO directly on the USB stick (overwriting it in the process):

        dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdc1

and boot the system using that USB stick ([hold the `option` key during boot on Apple hardware](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255)).

# Mount the encrypted partition

Assuming a drive which is partitioned this way:

- `/dev/sda1`: EFI partition
- `/dev/sda2`: unencrypted boot partition
- `/dev/sda3`: encrypted LVM partition

Open a terminal and [mount the required partitions](https://superuser.com/questions/165116/mount-dev-proc-sys-in-a-chroot-environment):

    cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda3 sda3_crypt
    vgchange -ay
    mount /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root /mnt
    mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot
    mount -t proc proc /mnt/proc
    mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev

Note:

- When running `cryptsetup luksOpen`, you must use the same name as the one
  that is in `/etc/crypttab` on the root parition (`sda3_crypt` in this
  example).

- All of these partitions must be present (**including `/proc` and `/dev`**) for
  the initramfs scripts to do all of their work. If you see errors or
  warnings, you must resolve them.

# Regenerate the initramfs on the boot partition

Then "enter" the root partition using:

    chroot /mnt

and make sure that the [lvm2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lvm2)
package is installed:

    apt install lvm2

before regenerating the initramfs for all of the installed kernels:

    update-initramfs -c -k all

[[!tag debian]] [[!tag nzoss]] [[!tag ubuntu]] [[!tag luks]] [[!tag lvm]]
