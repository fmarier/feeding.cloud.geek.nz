In order to easily authenticate with IRC networks such as
[OFTC](https://www.oftc.net/NickServ/CertFP/) and
[Freenode](https://freenode.net/kb/answer/certfp), it is possible to use
*client TLS certificates* (also known as *SSL certificates*). In fact, it
turns out that it's very easy to setup both on [irssi](https://irssi.org/)
and on [znc](https://wiki.znc.in/).

# Generate your TLS certificate

On a machine with [good entropy](http://altusmetrum.org/ChaosKey/), run the
following command to create a keypair that will last for 10 years:

    openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout user.pem -x509 -days 3650 -out user.pem -subj "/CN=<your nick>"

Then extract your key fingerprint using this command:

    openssl x509 -sha1 -noout -fingerprint -in user.pem | sed -e 's/^.*=//;s/://g'

# Share your fingerprints with NickServ

On each IRC network, do this:

    /msg NickServ IDENTIFY Password1!
    /msg NickServ CERT ADD <your fingerprint>

in order to add your fingerprint to the access control list.

# Configure ZNC

To configure znc, start by putting the key in the right place:

    cp user.pem ~/.znc/users/<your nick>/networks/oftc/moddata/cert/

and then enable the built-in [cert plugin](https://wiki.znc.in/Cert) for
each network in `~/.znc/configs/znc.conf`:

    <Network oftc>
        ...
                LoadModule = cert
        ...
	</Network>
        <Network freenode>
        ...
                LoadModule = cert
        ...
	</Network>

# Configure irssi

For irssi, do the same thing but put the cert in `~/.irssi/user.pem` and
then change the OFTC entry in `~/.irssi/config` to look like this:

    {
      address = "irc.oftc.net";
      chatnet = "OFTC";
      port = "6697";
      use_tls = "yes";
      tls_cert = "~/.irssi/user.pem";
      tls_verify = "yes";
      autoconnect = "yes";
    }

and the Freenode one to look like this:

    {
      address = "chat.freenode.net";
      chatnet = "Freenode";
      port = "7000";
      use_tls = "yes";
      tls_cert = "~/.irssi/user.pem";
      tls_verify = "yes";
      autoconnect = "yes";
    }

That's it. That's all you need to replace password authentication with a
much stronger alternative.
