I've used your OpenVPN posts as a starting point for my own openvpn experiments.

Is there a reason why you chose the Android App [OpenVPN for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn) over [OpenVPN Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.openvpn.openvpn)?

I couldn't find much on the differences in the documentation/FAQ of those projects. I've ended up using 'OpenVPN Connect' since it is claimed that it is the 'official' OpenVPN app - and because it is installed/rated by more users.

Do you know some advantages of one over the other?

Regarding the settings on the Android device - I generally dislike the idea of having to navigate complex configuration dialogs in an android app. Fortunately 'OpenVPN Connect' supports importing the settings, keys and certificate from a single `.ovpn` profile file ('OpenVPN for Android' supports this, too, it seems). With that you can even include the certificates and keys inline.

Your example settings translated to `.ovpn` syntax should look like:

    client
    dev tun
    proto udp
    remote openvpn-gateway.example.org 1194
    resolv-retry infinite
    nobind
    persist-key
    persist-tun
    remote-cert-tls server
    comp-lzo
    cipher AES-256-CBC
    auth SHA384
    <ca>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    [..]
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    </ca>
    <cert> 
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    [..]
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    </cert>
    <key>
    -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
    [..]
    -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    </key>

    key-direction 1
    <tls-auth>
    -----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1-----
    [..]
    -----END OpenVPN Static key V1-----
    </tls-auth>

I've tested it with 'OpenVPN Connect' on Android 5 and it works as expected.
