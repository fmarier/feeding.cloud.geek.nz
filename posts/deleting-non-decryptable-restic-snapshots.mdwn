Due to what I suspect is disk corruption error due to a faulty RAM module or
network interface on my [GnuBee](http://gnubee.org/), my
[restic](https://restic.net/) backup failed with the following error:

    $ restic check
    using temporary cache in /var/tmp/restic-tmp/restic-check-cache-854484247

    Fatal: repository contains errors

I started by locating the snapshots which make use of these corrupt trees:

    $ restic find --tree 4645312b
    repository b0b0516c opened successfully, password is correct
    Found tree 4645312b443338d57295550f2f4c135c34bda7b17865c4153c9b99d634ae641c

     ... path /usr/include/boost/spirit/home/support/char_encoding
     ... in snapshot e75876ed (2021-02-28 08:35:29)

and then deleted them:

    $ restic forget 41e138c8 e75876ed

    [0:00] 100.00%  2 / 2 files deleted

As you can see above, the `prune` command failed due to a corrupt pack and
so I followed the [process I previously wrote
about](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/removing-corrupted-data-pack-restic-backup/)
and identified the affected snapshots using:

    $ restic find --pack 9ec955794534be06356655cfee6abe73cb181f88bb86b0cd769cf8699f9f9e57

before deleting them with:

    $ restic forget 031ab8f1 1672a9e1 1f23fb5b 2c58ea3a 331c7231 5e0e1936 735c6744 94f74bdb b11df023 dfa17ba8 e3f78133 eefbd0b0 fe88aeb5 
    repository b0b0516c opened successfully, password is correct
    [0:00] 100.00%  13 / 13 files deleted

    $ restic prune

    load all snapshots
    find data that is still in use for 8 snapshots

    remove 7507 old packs
    [0:08] 100.00%  7507 / 7507 files deleted
    done

And with 13 of my 21 snapshots deleted, the checks now pass:

    $ restic check
    using temporary cache in /var/tmp/restic-tmp/restic-check-cache-407999210
    repository b0b0516c opened successfully, password is correct
    created new cache in /var/tmp/restic-tmp/restic-check-cache-407999210
    create exclusive lock for repository
    load indexes
    check all packs
    check snapshots, trees and blobs
    no errors were found

This represents a significant amount of lost backup history, but at least
it's not all of it.
