The [Moodle](http://www.moodle.org/) learning management system has one of the most vibrant and diversified communities in the [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) world. There are lots of ways to get involved and most of them are not restricted to people with a programming background.  
  
If you are a web developer however, sharing your custom code with the wider Moodle community is a great way to:

  * increase its **quality**,
  * generate more **ideas**,
  * get it **translated** into many languages,
  * improve its **usability**,
  * supplement its existing **documentation**,
  * and sometimes can even get **funding** for enhancements!

There are [many ways to contribute code](http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:Guidelines_for_contributed_code) to Moodle, but if you decide that your customisations could be useful to others, then you should think about [submitting your project to the "contrib" area](http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:contrib).  
  
The process is quite simple: simply announce your module or plug-in on the appropriate [Moodle discussion forum](http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=44) and attach a [zip file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_%28file_format%29) containing:

  1. source code
  2. installation instructions
  3. a copy of the [licence](https://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html)
  4. your contact details (email or website)

Just like [starting a Free Software project](/2008/09/starting-free-software-project.html), contributing code to Moodle and seeing a [community of users grow around your code](/2008/09/growing-community-around-your-new-free.html) can be a highly motivating experience. Happy Moodling!
