You can edit /var/cache/debconf/config.dat manually instead, but be aware that you can really break things by editing this.

The file it uses for configuration is defined in /etc/debconf.conf, should it not be where you expect on your system

    # World-readable, and accepts everything but passwords.
    Name: config
    Driver: File
    Mode: 644
    Reject-Type: password
    Filename: /var/cache/debconf/config.dat
