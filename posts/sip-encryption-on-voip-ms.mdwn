My [VoIP provider](https://voip.ms/en/invite/MjE0NTI2) recently added [support for
TLS/SRTP-based call
encryption](https://wiki.voip.ms/article/Call_Encryption_-_TLS/SRTP). Here's
what I did to enable this feature on my
[Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/) server.

First of all, I changed the registration line in `/etc/asterisk/sip.conf` to
use the "tls" scheme:

    [general]
    register => tls://mydid:mypassword@servername.voip.ms

then I enabled incoming TCP connections:

    tcpenable=yes

and TLS:

    tlsenable=yes
    tlscapath=/etc/ssl/certs/

Finally, I changed my provider entry in the same file to:

    [voipms]
    type=friend
    host=servername.voip.ms
    secret=mypassword
    username=mydid
    context=from-voipms
    allow=ulaw
    allow=g729
    insecure=port,invite
    transport=tls
    encryption=yes

(Note the last two lines.)

The dialplan didn't change and so I still have the following in
`/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf`:

    [pstn-voipms]
    exten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,1,Set(CALLERID(all)=Francois Marier <5551234567>)
    exten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,n,Dial(SIP/voipms/${EXTEN})
    exten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,n,Hangup()
    exten => _NXXNXXXXXX,1,Set(CALLERID(all)=Francois Marier <5551234567>)
    exten => _NXXNXXXXXX,n,Dial(SIP/voipms/1${EXTEN})
    exten => _NXXNXXXXXX,n,Hangup()
    exten => _011X.,1,Set(CALLERID(all)=Francois Marier <5551234567>)
    exten => _011X.,n,Authenticate(1234) ; require password for international calls
    exten => _011X.,n,Dial(SIP/voipms/${EXTEN})
    exten => _011X.,n,Hangup(16)

## Server certificate

The only thing I still need to fix is to make this error message go away in
my logs:

    asterisk[8691]: ERROR[8691]: tcptls.c:966 in __ssl_setup: TLS/SSL error loading cert file. <asterisk.pem>

It appears to be related to the fact that I didn't set `tlscertfile` in
`/etc/asterisk/sip.conf` and that it's using its default value of
`asterisk.pem`, a non-existent file.

Since my Asterisk server is only acting as a TLS *client*, and not a TLS
*server*, there's probably no harm in not having a certificate. That said,
it looks pretty easy to [use a Let's Encrypt cert with
Asterisk](https://community.asterisk.org/t/has-anyone-used-letsencrypt-to-setup-ssl-for-asterisk/67145/6).
