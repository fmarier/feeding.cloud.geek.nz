If you are in the middle of a failed
[Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) `hg histedit`, you can normally
do `hg histedit --abort` to cancel it, though sometimes you also have to
reach out for `hg update -C`. This is the equivalent of
[git](https://git-scm.com/)'s `git rebase --abort` and it does what you'd
expect.

However, if you go ahead and finish the history rewriting and only notice
problems later, it's not as straighforward. With git, I'd look into the
[reflog](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-reflog)
(`git reflog`) for the previous value of the branch pointer and simply `git
reset --hard` to that value. Done.

Based on a [Stack Overflow
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43742808/how-do-i-recover-from-a-botched-histedit-in-mercurial),
I thought I could undo my botched histedit using:

    hg unbundle ~/devel/mozilla-unified/.hg/strip-backup/47906774d58d-ae1953e1-backup.hg

but it didn't seem to work. Maybe it doesn't work when using
[bookmarks](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Bookmarks).

Here's what I ended up doing to fully revert my botched Mercurial
[histedit](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/HisteditExtension). If you
know of a simpler way to do this, feel free to leave a comment.

# Collecting the commits to restore

The first step was to collect all of the commits hashes I needed to restore.
Luckily, I had sumitted my patch to
[Try](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/TryServer) before changing
it and so I was able to look at the
[pushlog](https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/hashstore-crash-1434206)
to get all of the commits at once.

If I didn't have that, I could also go to the [last bookmark I
pushed](https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/hashstore-crash-1434206)
and click on parent commits until I hit the [first one that's not
mine](https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/ff8505d177b9).
Then I could collect all of the commits using the browser's back button:

- <https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/3c31c543e736>
- <https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/7ddfe5ae2fa6>
- <https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/c04b620136c7>
- <https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/2d1bf04fd155>
- <https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/e194843f5b7a>
- <https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/47906774d58d>
- <https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/f6a657bca64f>
- <https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/0d7a4e1c0079>

- <https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/b1565f3aacdb>
- <https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/3fdd157bb698>

- <https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/c927a5205abe>
- <https://hg.mozilla.org/users/fmarier_mozilla.com/mozilla-unified/rev/4140cd9c67b0>

For that last one, I had to click on the changeset commit hash link in order to
get the commit hash instead of the name of the bookmark (`/rev/hashstore-crash-1434206`).

# Recreating the branch from scratch

This is what did to export patches for each commit and then re-import them
one after the other:

    for c in 3c31c543e736 7ddfe5ae2fa6 c04b620136c7 2d1bf04fd155 e194843f5b7a 47906774d58d f6a657bca64f 0d7a4e1c0079 976e25b49758 a1a382f2e773 b1565f3aacdb 3fdd157bb698 b1b041990577 220bf5cd9e2a c927a5205abe ; do hg export $c > ~/$c.patch ; done
    hg up ff8505d177b9
    hg bookmarks hashstore-crash-1434206-new
    for c in 3c31c543e736 7ddfe5ae2fa6 c04b620136c7 2d1bf04fd155 e194843f5b7a 47906774d58d f6a657bca64f 0d7a4e1c0079 976e25b49758 a1a382f2e773 b1565f3aacdb 3fdd157bb698 b1b041990577 220bf5cd9e2a c927a5205abe 4140cd9c67b0 ; do hg import ~/$c.patch ; done

# Copying a bookmark

As an aside, if you want to make a copy of a bookmark before you do an `hg
histedit`, it's not as simple as:

    hg up hashstore-crash-1434206
    hg bookmarks hashstore-crash-1434206-copy
    hg up hashstore-crash-1434206

While that seemed to work at the time, the `histedit` ended up messing with
both of them.

An alternative that works is to push the bookmark to another machine. That
way if worse comes to worse, you can `hg clone` from there and `hg export`
the commits you want to re-import using `hg import`.
