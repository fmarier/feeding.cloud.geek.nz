> Do you use IPv6? How do you update the IPv6 ?

Unfortunately, No-IP still [doesn't support IPv6 in their Dynamic DNS service](https://www.noip.com/blog/2009/06/19/ipv6-records-now-available/#comment-421947). My setup is IPv4-only.

I'd be happy to consider other services that support IPv6 if they also support **custom domains** and are supported by a **client that's included in Debian**. If you know of one, please leave a comment.
