After upgrading an Ubuntu 14.04 ("trusty") machine to the latest 16.04
[Hardware Enablement](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack)
packages, I ran into login problems. I could log into my user account and
see the GNOME desktop for a split second before getting thrown back into the
LightDM login manager.

The solution I found was to install this missing package:

    apt install libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-xenial

# Looking for clues in the logs

The first place I looked was the log file for the login manager
(`/var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log`) where I found the following:

    DEBUG: Session pid=12743: Running command /usr/sbin/lightdm-session gnome-session --session=gnome
    DEBUG: Creating shared data directory /var/lib/lightdm-data/username
    DEBUG: Session pid=12743: Logging to .xsession-errors

This told me that the login manager runs the `gnome-session` command and
gets it to create a session of type *gnome*. That command line is defined
in `/usr/share/xsessions/gnome.desktop` (look for `Exec=`):

    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=GNOME
    Comment=This session logs you into GNOME
    Exec=gnome-session --session=gnome
    TryExec=gnome-shell
    X-LightDM-DesktopName=GNOME

I couldn't see anything unexpected there, but it did point to another log
file (`~/.xsession-errors`) which contained the following:

    Script for ibus started at run_im.
    Script for auto started at run_im.
    Script for default started at run_im.
    init: Le processus gnome-session (GNOME) main (11946) s'est achevé avec l'état 1
    init: Déconnecté du bus D-Bus notifié
    init: Le processus logrotate main (11831) a été tué par le signal TERM
    init: Le processus update-notifier-crash (/var/crash/_usr_bin_unattended-upgrade.0.crash) main (11908) a été tué par le signal TERM

Seaching for French error messages isn't as useful as searching for English
ones, so I took a look at `/var/log/syslog` and found this:

    gnome-session[4134]: WARNING: App 'gnome-shell.desktop' exited with code 127
    gnome-session[4134]: WARNING: App 'gnome-shell.desktop' exited with code 127
    gnome-session[4134]: WARNING: App 'gnome-shell.desktop' respawning too quickly
    gnome-session[4134]: CRITICAL: We failed, but the fail whale is dead. Sorry....

It looks like `gnome-session` is executing `gnome-shell` and that this last
command is terminating prematurely. This would explain why `gnome-session`
exits immediately after login.

# Increasing the amount of logging

In order to get more verbose debugging information out of `gnome-session`, I
created a new type of session (*GNOME debug*) by copying the regular *GNOME*
session:

    cp /usr/share/xsessions/gnome.desktop /usr/share/xsessions/gnome-debug.desktop

and then adding `--debug` to the command line inside `gnome-debug.desktop`:

    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=GNOME debug
    Comment=This session logs you into GNOME debug
    Exec=gnome-session --debug --session=gnome
    TryExec=gnome-shell
    X-LightDM-DesktopName=GNOME debug

After restarting LightDM (`service lightdm restart`), I clicked the GNOME
logo next to the password field and chose *GNOME debug* before trying to
login again.

This time, I had a lot more information in `~/.xsession-errors`:

    gnome-session[12878]: DEBUG(+): GsmAutostartApp: starting gnome-shell.desktop: command=/usr/bin/gnome-shell startup-id=10d41f1f5c81914ec61471971137183000000128780000
    gnome-session[12878]: DEBUG(+): GsmAutostartApp: started pid:13121
    ...
    /usr/bin/gnome-shell: error while loading shared libraries: libwayland-egl.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    gnome-session[12878]: DEBUG(+): GsmAutostartApp: (pid:13121) done (status:127)
    gnome-session[12878]: WARNING: App 'gnome-shell.desktop' exited with code 127

which suggests that `gnome-shell` won't start because of a missing library.

# Finding the missing library

To find the missing library, I used the [apt-file](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt-file) command:

    apt-file update
    apt-file search libwayland-egl.so.1

and found that this file is provided by the following packages:

- libhybris
- libwayland-egl1-mesa
- libwayland-egl1-mesa-dbg
- libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-utopic
- libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-vivid
- libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-wily
- libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-xenial

Since I installed the LTS Enablement stack, the package I needed to install to fix this
was [libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-xenial](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/trusty/+package/libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-xenial).

I filed [a bug for this on Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel-lts-xenial/+bug/1616734).
