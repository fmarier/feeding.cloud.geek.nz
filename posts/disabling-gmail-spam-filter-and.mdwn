I've been using GMail ever since they decided to allow users to download their mail using [POP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol). I was happy reading my email as usual in [mutt](/2008/04/handling-multiple-identitiesaccounts-in.html). The only problem was that I had to log onto the website once in a while to clear out my spam folder and fish out the false positives.  
  
However, as the amount of spam I receive daily started growing exponentially (in part thanks to my involvement in [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)), I became more and more dissatisfied with this solution. I had to login several times a day just to keep the levels of spam down to a manageable level. I tried [emailing the GMail support team](http://netzreport.googlepages.com/gmail_the_problem_with_spam_mails.html) a few times without success.  
  
The solution came just as I was looking at switching to a different email provider: [IMAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imap) access.  
  
Using [fetchmail](http://fetchmail.berlios.de/), I can now download my received and sent mail using POP and then download (and purge) the contents of my spam folder. Here are the relevant lines of my `~/.fetchmailrc`:  

    poll pop.gmail.com protocol pop3 user "fmarier@gmail.com" is "francois" password "" fetchall ssl
    poll imap.gmail.com protocol imap user "fmarier@gmail.com" is "francois" password "" folder "[Gmail]/Spam" fetchall ssl

I can then run all of my mail through my own [local SpamAssassin setup](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/filtering-own-spam-using-spamassassin/).
