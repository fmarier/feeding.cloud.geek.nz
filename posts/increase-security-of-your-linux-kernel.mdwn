Wikipedia has a [pretty good explanation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grsecurity) of what [grsecurity](http://www.grsecurity.net/) and [PaX](http://pax.grsecurity.net/) do, but in a nutshell, here's what this set of patches buys you:  

  * non-executable stack
  * address-space randomization
  * role-based access control
  * chroot hardening
  * enhanced auditing

If you're looking for a quick way of downloading the latest stable Linux kernel with the grsecurity patch already applied, clone this git repository (which can be [browsed here](http://git.catalyst.net.nz/gitweb?p=linux-2.6.24-grsec.git)):  

    git-clone http://git.catalyst.net.nz/linux-2.6.24-grsec.git

I also maintain an RSS feed (well, an Atom feed actually) keeping track of the latest grsecurity and PaX test patches:  

> [http://feeds.feedburner.com/grsecurity](http://feeds.feedburner.com/grsecurity)

Finally, make sure you run [paxtest](http://packages.debian.org/sid/paxtest) to make sure that the protections offered by grsecurity and PaX are properly enabled.
