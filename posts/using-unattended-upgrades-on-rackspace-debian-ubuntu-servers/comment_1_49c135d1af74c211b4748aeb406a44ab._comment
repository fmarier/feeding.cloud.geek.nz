Did you look in the comment in /etc/apt/preferences.d/50unattended-upgrades?  Yes, it is was so incomplete you did have to read the source to find out how to use it.  And like you I did that.  And then I wrote it up like you did here, and filed a bug whinging about it to the maintainer for good measure.

The maintainer turns out to be a very nice fellow.  So now in jessie it's I think it's pretty good doco, although I'm probably not the best judge since I wrote it.
