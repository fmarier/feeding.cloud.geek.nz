I noticed that I was receiving some bounced email notifications from a
domain I own (`cloud.geek.nz`) to host my blog. These notifications were all
for spam messages spoofing the `From` address since I do not use that domain
for email.

I decided to try setting a strict [DMARC
policy](https://dmarcly.com/blog/how-to-implement-dmarc-dkim-spf-to-stop-email-spoofing-phishing-the-definitive-guide)
to see if DMARC-using mail servers (e.g. GMail) would then drop these
spoofed emails without notifying me about it.

I started by setting this initial DMARC policy in DNS in order to monitor the change:

    @ TXT v=spf1 -all
    _dmarc TXT v=DMARC1; p=none; ruf=mailto:dmarc@fmarier.org; sp=none; aspf=s; fo=0:1:d:s;

Then I waited three weeks without receiving anything before updating the
relevant DNS records to this final DMARC policy:

    @ TXT v=spf1 -all
    _dmarc TXT v=DMARC1; p=reject; sp=reject; aspf=s;

This policy states that nobody is allowed to send emails for this domain and
that any incoming email claiming to be from this domain should be silently
rejected.

I haven't noticed any bounce notifications for messages spoofing this domain
in a while, so maybe it's working?
