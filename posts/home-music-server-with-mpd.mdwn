I recently setup a music server on my home server using the [Music Player
Daemon](https://www.musicpd.org/), a cross-platform [free
software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) project which has
been around for a long time.

# Basic setup

Start by installing the server and the client package:

    apt install mpd mpc

then open `/etc/mpd.conf` and set these:

    music_directory    "/path/to/music/"
    bind_to_address    "192.168.1.2"
    bind_to_address    "/run/mpd/socket"
    zeroconf_enabled   "yes"
    password           "Password1"

before replacing the alsa output:

    audio_output {
       type    "alsa"
       name    "My ALSA Device"
    }

with a pulseaudio one:

    audio_output {
       type    "pulse"
       name    "Pulseaudio Output"
    }

In order for the automatic detection (zeroconf) of your music server
to work, you need to [prevent systemd from creating the network
socket](https://www.mail-archive.com/mpd-devel@musicpd.org/msg00239.html):

    systemctl stop mpd.service
    systemctl stop mpd.socket
    systemctl disable mpd.socket

otherwise you'll see this in `/var/log/mpd/mpd.log`:

    zeroconf: No global port, disabling zeroconf

Once all of that is in place, start the mpd daemon:

    systemctl start mpd.service

and create an index of your music files:

    MPD_HOST=Password1@/run/mpd/socket mpc update

while watching the logs to notice any files that the mpd user doesn't have
access to:

    tail -f /var/log/mpd/mpd.log

# Enhancements

I also added the following in `/etc/logcheck/ignore.server.d/local-mpd` to
silence unnecessary log messages in
[logcheck](https://packages.debian.org/stable/logcheck) emails:

    ^\w{3} [ :0-9]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ systemd\[1\]: Started Music Player Daemon.$
    ^\w{3} [ :0-9]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ systemd\[1\]: Stopped Music Player Daemon.$
    ^\w{3} [ :0-9]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ systemd\[1\]: Stopping Music Player Daemon...$

and created a cronjob in `/etc/cron.d/mpd-francois` to update the database
daily and stop the music automatically in the evening:

    # Refresh DB once an hour
    5 * * * *  mpd  MPD_HOST=Password1@/run/mpd/socket test -r /run/mpd/socket && /usr/bin/mpc --quiet update
    # Think of the neighbours
    0 22 * * 0-4  mpd  MPD_HOST=Password1@/run/mpd/socket test -r /run/mpd/socket && /usr/bin/mpc --quiet stop
    0 23 * * 5-6  mpd  MPD_HOST=Password1@/run/mpd/socket test -r /run/mpd/socket && /usr/bin/mpc --quiet stop

# Clients

To let anybody on the local network connect, I opened **port 6600** on the
firewall (`/etc/network/iptables.up.rules` since I'm using Debian's
`iptables-apply`):

    -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -p tcp --dport 6600 -j ACCEPT

Then I looked at [the long list of clients](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients) on the mpd wiki.

## Desktop

The official website [suggests two
clients](https://www.musicpd.org/clients/) which are available in Debian and
Ubuntu:

- [Ario](http://ario-player.sourceforge.net/) (`apt install ario`)
- [GNOME Music Player Client](http://gmpclient.org/) (`apt install gmpc gmpc-plugins`)

Both of them work well, but haven't had a release since 2011, even though
there is some activity
in [2013](https://sourceforge.net/p/ario-player/code/HEAD/tree/)
and [2015](http://repo.or.cz/w/gmpc.git) in their respective source control
repositories.

Ario has a simpler user interface but gmpc has cover art download
working out of the box, which is why I might stick with it.

In both cases, it is possible to [configure a polipo
proxy](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/things-that-work-well-with-tor/)
so that any external resources are fetched via
[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).

## Android

On Android, I got these two to work:

- [M.A.L.P.](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=malp&fdid=org.gateshipone.malp) (requires Android 5 or later)
- [MPDroid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=mpdroid&fdid=com.namelessdev.mpdroid)

I picked M.A.L.P. since it includes a nice widget for the homescreen.

## iOS

On iOS, these are the most promising clients I found:

- [MPDRemote](https://github.com/Nyx0uf/MPDRemote) (free software, not on the AppStore)
- [MPDluxe](http://kineticfactory.com/MPDluxe/) (proprietary, sold on the [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/app/mpdluxe/id991758069?mt=8))

since [MPoD](http://www.katoemba.net/makesnosenseatall/mpod/) and
[MPaD](http://www.katoemba.net/makesnosenseatall/mpad/) don't appear to be
available on the AppStore anymore.
