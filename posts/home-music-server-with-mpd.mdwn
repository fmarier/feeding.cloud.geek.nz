I recently setup a music server on my home server using the [Music Player
Daemon](https://www.musicpd.org/), a cross-platform [free
software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) project which has
been around for a long time.

# Basic setup

Start by installing the server and the client package:

    apt install mpd mpc

then open `/etc/mpd.conf` and set these:

    music_directory    "/path/to/music/"
    bind_to_address    "192.168.1.2"
    bind_to_address    "/run/mpd/socket"
    zeroconf_enabled   "yes"
    password           "Password1"

before replacing the alsa output:

    audio_output {
       type    "alsa"
       name    "My ALSA Device"
    }

with a pulseaudio one:

    audio_output {
       type    "pulse"
       name    "Pulseaudio Output"
       server  "127.0.0.1"
    }

and exposing pulseaudio to localhost via `/etc/pulse/default.pa`:

    ### Network access (may be configured with paprefs, so leave this commented
    ### here if you plan to use paprefs)
    load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1

In order for the automatic detection (zeroconf) of your music server
to work, you need to [prevent systemd from creating the network
socket](https://www.mail-archive.com/mpd-devel@musicpd.org/msg00239.html):

    systemctl stop mpd.service
    systemctl stop mpd.socket
    systemctl disable mpd.socket

otherwise you'll see this in `/var/log/mpd/mpd.log`:

    zeroconf: No global port, disabling zeroconf

Once all of that is in place, start the mpd daemon:

    systemctl start mpd.service

and create an index of your music files:

    MPD_HOST=Password1@/run/mpd/socket mpc update

while watching the logs to notice any files that the mpd user doesn't have
access to:

    tail -f /var/log/mpd/mpd.log

# Enhancements

I also added the following in `/etc/logcheck/ignore.server.d/local-mpd` to
silence unnecessary log messages in
[logcheck](https://packages.debian.org/stable/logcheck) emails:

    ^\w{3} [ :0-9]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ systemd\[1\]: Started Music Player Daemon.$
    ^\w{3} [ :0-9]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ systemd\[1\]: Stopped Music Player Daemon.$
    ^\w{3} [ :0-9]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ systemd\[1\]: Stopping Music Player Daemon...$

and created a cronjob in `/etc/cron.d/mpd-francois` to update the database
daily and stop the music automatically in the evening:

    # Refresh DB once an hour
    5 * * * *  mpd  test -r /run/mpd/socket && MPD_HOST=Password1@/run/mpd/socket /usr/bin/mpc --quiet update
    # Think of the neighbours
    0 22 * * 0-4  mpd  test -r /run/mpd/socket && MPD_HOST=Password1@/run/mpd/socket /usr/local/bin/mpc-fade
    0 23 * * 5-6  mpd  test -r /run/mpd/socket && MPD_HOST=Password1@/run/mpd/socket /usr/local/bin/mpc-fade

My [`mpc-fade` script](https://github.com/fmarier/user-scripts/blob/master/mpc-fade),
heavily inspired by [Guillaume's](http://guillaumeplayground.net/mpd-mpc-fade-in-out-script/),
gradually brings the volume down instead of stopping the music abrutly.

## Album covers

In order to supply album cover art to clients which support grabbing covers
from a local web server I have installed
[Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/):

    apt install apache2

and configured it to serve the covers by putting the following in
`/etc/apache2/conf-available/mpd.conf`:

    <Directory /path/to/music>
        AllowOverride None
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

and then the following line in the default vhost section of
`/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf`:

    Alias /music /path/to/music

Finally, I enabled the new configuration and restarted Apache:

    a2enconf mpd.conf
    systemctl restart apache2.service

# Clients

To let anybody on the local network connect, I opened **ports 80 and 6600**
on the firewall (`/etc/network/iptables.up.rules` since I'm using Debian's
`iptables-apply`):

    -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -p tcp --dport 6600 -j ACCEPT

Then I looked at [the long list of clients](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients) on the mpd wiki.

## Desktop

The official website [suggests two
clients](https://www.musicpd.org/clients/) which are available in Debian and
Ubuntu:

- [Ario](http://ario-player.sourceforge.net/) (`apt install ario`)
- [GNOME Music Player Client](http://gmpclient.org/) (`apt install gmpc gmpc-plugins`)

Both of them work well, but haven't had a release since 2011, even though
there is some activity
in [2013](https://sourceforge.net/p/ario-player/code/HEAD/tree/)
and [2015](http://repo.or.cz/w/gmpc.git) in their respective source control
repositories.

Ario has a simpler user interface but gmpc has cover art download
working out of the box, which is why I might stick with it.

In both cases, it is possible to [configure a polipo
proxy](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/things-that-work-well-with-tor/)
so that any external resources are fetched via
[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).

## Android

On Android, I got these two to work:

- [M.A.L.P.](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=malp&fdid=org.gateshipone.malp) (requires Android 5 or later)
- [MPDroid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=mpdroid&fdid=com.namelessdev.mpdroid)

I picked M.A.L.P. since it includes a nice widget for the homescreen. In the
profile settings, I enabled *Prefer [HTTP cover
files](https://github.com/gateship-one/malp/wiki/FAQ#application-usage)* and
used this URL:

    http://192.168.1.2/%d

## iOS

On iOS, these are the most promising clients I found:

- [MPDRemote](https://github.com/Nyx0uf/MPDRemote) (free software, sold on the [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mpdremote/id1202933180?ls=1&mt=8))
- [MPDluxe](http://kineticfactory.com/MPDluxe/) (proprietary, sold on the [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/app/mpdluxe/id991758069?mt=8))

since [MPoD](http://www.katoemba.net/makesnosenseatall/mpod/) and
[MPaD](http://www.katoemba.net/makesnosenseatall/mpad/) don't appear to be
available on the AppStore anymore.

Of these, MPDRemote appears to be the better one. It also supports album art
if you configure the profile with the following cover URL:

    http://192.168.1.2/
