[Tor](https://torproject.org) is a proxy server which allows its users to
hide their IP address from the websites they connect to. In order to provide
this level of anonymity however, it introduces latency into these
connections, an unfortunate performance-privacy trade-off which means that
few users choose to do all of their browsing through Tor.

Here are a few things that I have found work quite well through Tor. If
there are any other interesting use cases I've missed, please leave a comment!

# Tor setup

There are already great docs on how to
[install and configure the Tor server](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-unix.html.en)
and the only thing I would add is that I've found that having a [Polipo](http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~jch/software/polipo/) proxy
around is quite useful for those applications that support HTTP
proxies but not [SOCKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) proxies.

On Debian, it's just a matter of installing the
[polipo](http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/polipo) package and then
configuring it as [it used to be recommended by the Tor project](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/blob/21e3c22670f0ceb1760b3403ff1a217301112e9d:/build-scripts/config/polipo.conf).

# RSS feeds

The whole idea behind [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feeds is that
articles are downloaded in batch ahead of time. In other words, latency
doesn't matter.

I use [akregator](http://userbase.kde.org/Akregator) to read blogs and the
way to make it fetch articles over Tor is to change the
[KDE](http://kde.org)-wide proxy server using `systemsettings` and setting a
manual proxy of `localhost` on port `8008` (i.e. the local instance of
Polipo). If you don't see the proxy settings in the KDE control panel, make
sure that the `kde-baseapps-bin`, `libkonq-common` and `kpart-webkit` packages
are installed.

Similarly, I use [podget](http://podget.sourceforge.net/) to automatically
fetch podcasts through this cron job in `/etc/cron.d/podget-francois`:

    0 12 * * 1-5 francois	http_proxy=http://localhost:8008/ https_proxy=http://localhost:8008/ nocache nice ionice -n7 /usr/bin/podget -s

Prior to that, I was using
[hpodder](https://github.com/jgoerzen/hpodder/wiki) and had the following in
`~/.hpodder/curlrc`:

    proxy=socks4a://localhost:9050

# GnuPG

For those of us using the [GNU Privacy Guard](http://gnupg.org/) to exchange
[encrypted emails](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto),
keeping our public keyring up to date is important since it's the only way
to ensure that
[revoked keys](https://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/136-distroblogs/6775-the-need-for-a-gpg-revocation-certificate)
are taken into account. The
[script I use](https://github.com/fmarier/user-scripts/blob/master/gpg-refresh-keys)
for this runs once a day and has the unfortunate side effect of revealing the
contents of my address book to the [keyserver](http://pgp.net.nz) I use.

Therefore, I figured that I should at least hide my IP address by putting
the following in `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`:

    keyserver-options http-proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8008

However, that tends to makes key submission fail and so I created a key
submission alias in my `~/.bashrc` which avoids sending keys through Tor:

    alias gpgsendkeys='gpg --send-keys --keyserver-options http-proxy=""'

# Instant messaging

Communication via [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP) is another use
case that's not affected much by a bit of extra latency.

To get [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/) to talk to an XMPP server over Tor,
simply open "Tools | Preferences" and set a `SOCKS5` (**not** `Tor/Privacy`)
proxy of `localhost` on port `9050`.

# GMail

Finally, I found that since I am
[running GMail in a separate browser profile](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/keeping-gmail-in-separate-browser/),
I can take advantage of GMail's excellent caching and preloading and run the
whole thing over Tor by setting that entire browser profile to run its
traffic through the Tor SOCKS proxy on port `9050`.
