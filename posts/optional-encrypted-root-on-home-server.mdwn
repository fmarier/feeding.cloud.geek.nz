I have a computer that serves as a home server as well as a desktop
machine. It has an encrypted home directory to protect user files and, in
the default configuration, that unfortunately interferes with unattended
reboots since someone needs to be present to enter the encryption password.

Here's how I added a timeout and made `/home` optional on that machine.

I started by adding a one-minute timeout on the password prompt by adding
`timeout=60` in my `/etc/crypttab`:

    crypt  UUID=7e12c123-abcd-5555-8c40-900d1f8cc281  none  luks,timeout=60

then I made `/home` optional by adding `nofail` to the appropriate mount
point in `/etc/fstab`:

    /dev/mapper/crypt  /home  ext4  nodev,noatime,nosuid,nofail  0  2

Before that, the password prompt would timeout but the system would be
unable to boot since one of the required partitions had failed to mount.

Now, to ensure that I don't accidentally re-create home directories for
users when the system is mounted without a `/home`, I made the `/home`
directory on the non-encrypted drive read-only:

    umount /home
    cd /home
    chmod a-w .

Finally, with all of this in place, I was now happy to configure the
machine to automatically reboot after a kernel panic by putting the
following in `/etc/sysctl.d/local.conf`:

    # Automatic reboot 10 seconds after a kernel panic
    kernel.panic = 10

since I know that the machine will come back up just fine and that all
services will be running. I simply won't be able to log into that machine as
any other user than `root` until I manually unlock and mount `/home`.
