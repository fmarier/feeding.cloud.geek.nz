The method I use is to boot another copy of Grub from somewhere (bootable CD, USB stick, or network boot -- it's easy to boot grub from any of these). Then, from the prompt, something like:
  
    root (hd0,0)
    setup (hd0)
    reboot
  
is all you need to install grub onto the disk.
  
Or, if you'd rather just boot into the system and fix it from there, I use something like:
  
    configfile (hd0,0)/boot/grub/menu.lst

(press escape)
