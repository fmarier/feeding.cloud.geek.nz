hi,  
  
your post comes a little bit too late as there is now etherpad lite offering tons of advantages over etherpad:  
  
https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite  
  
it is also where the current development happens while etherpad itself is kinda abandoned due to its deficiencies - especially its memory requirements.
