[Gogo](https://www.gogoair.com/for-passengers/), the WiFi provider for
[airlines like Air Canada](https://www.gogoair.com/participating-airlines/),
is not available to Linux users even though it advertises ["access using any
Wi-Fi enabled laptop, tablet or
smartphone"](https://www.gogoair.com/ac-bbyf/one-way-pass/detail/). It is
however possible to work-around this restriction by faking your browser
[user agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent).

I tried the [User-Agent Switcher for
Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg)
extension on Chrome and [Brave](https://brave.com/) but it didn't work
for some reason.

What did work was using Firefox and adding the following prefs in
`about:config` to spoof its user agent to Chrome for Windows:

    general.useragent.override=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.117 Safari/537.36
    general.useragent.updates.enabled=false
    privacy.resistFingerprinting=false

The last two prefs are necessary in order for the hidden
`general.useragent.override` pref to [not be
ignored](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/8ed108064bf1c83e508208e069a90cffb4045977/dom/base/Navigator.cpp#1892-1904).

# Opt out of mandatory arbitration

As an aside, the Gogo [terms of
service](https://content.gogoair.com/terms/aca/?lang=en_US) automatically
enroll you into [mandatory
arbitration](https://www.hotcoffeethemovie.com/default.asp?pg=mandatory_arbitration)
unless you opt out by sending an email to
[customercare@gogoair.com](mailto:customercare@gogoair.com) within 30 days
of using their service.

You may want to create an email template for this so that you can fire off a
quick email to them as soon as you connect. I will probably write a script
for it next time I use this service.
