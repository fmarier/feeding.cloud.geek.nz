If you see a message like this in your logs:

    ext4 filesystem being mounted at /boot supports timestamps until 2038 (0x7fffffff)

it's an indication that your filesystem is not [Y2k38](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem)-safe.

You can also check this manually using:

    $ tune2fs -l /dev/sda1 | grep "Inode size:"
    Inode size:	          128

where an inode size of `128` is insufficient beyond 2038 and an inode size
of `256` is what you want.

The safest way to change this is to copy the contents of your partition to another `ext4`
partition:

    cp -a /boot /mnt/backup/

and then reformat with the correct inode size:

    umount /boot
    mkfs.ext4 -I 256 /dev/sda1

before copying everything back:

    mount /boot
    cp -a /mnt/backup/boot/* /boot/
