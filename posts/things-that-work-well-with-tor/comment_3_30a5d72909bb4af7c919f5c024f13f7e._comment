Using Tor to login to services that identify you defeats the purpose of Tor.  Also, although 99% of people running Tor exits nodes are honest people, there is a risk of hitting a node with more nefarious purposes such as collecting user-names and passwords. Make sure you're using end-to-end encryption. Surf safe my friend.
