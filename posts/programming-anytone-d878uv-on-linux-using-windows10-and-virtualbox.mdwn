I recently acquired an [AnyTone AT-D878UV DMR
radio](https://www.bridgecomsystems.com/collections/amateur-handheld-radios/products/anytone-at-d878uv-dual-band-dmr-handheld-radio-w-gps-programming-cable)
which is unfortunately not supported by
[chirp](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home), my usual
go-to free software package for programming amateur radios.

Instead, I had to setup a Windows 10 virtual machine so that I could setup
the radio using the manufacturer's computer programming software (CPS).

# Install VirtualBox

Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org):

    apt install virtualbox virtualbox-guest-additions-iso

and add your user account to the `vboxusers` group:

    adduser francois vboxusers

to make filesharing before the host and the guest work.

Finally, **reboot** to ensure that group membership and kernel modules are
all set.

# Create a Windows 10 virtual machine

Create a new Windows 10 virtual machine within VirtualBox. Then, [download Windows
10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10ISO) from
Microsoft then start the virtual machine mounting the `.iso` file as an
optical drive.

Follow the instructions to install Windows 10, paying attention to the
[various privacy options you will be
offered](https://askleo.com/setting-up-windows-10-for-privacy/).

Once Windows is installed, mount the host's
`/usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso` as a virtual optical drive
and install the VirtualBox guest additions.

# Installing the CPS

With Windows fully setup, it's time to download the latest version of the
[computer programming
software](https://www.bridgecomsystems.com/pages/anytone-at-d878uv-support-page).

Unpack the downloaded file and then install it as Admin (right-click on the
`.exe`).

Do NOT install the GD driver update or the USB driver, they do not appear to
be necessary.

# Program the radio

First, you'll want to download from the radio to get a starting configuration
that you can change.

To do this:

1. Turn the radio on and wait until it has finished booting.
2. Plug the USB programming cable onto the computer and the radio.
3. From the CPS menu choose "Set COM port".
4. From the CPS menu choose "Read from radio".

**Save this original codeplug to a file as a backup** in case you need to
easily reset back to the factory settings.

To program the radio, follow this [handy third-party
guide](https://www.bridgecomsystems.com/blogs/bridgecom-tx-rx-blog/anytone-868-878-programming-guide-v1-33)
since it's much better than the official manual.

You should be able to use the "Write to radio" menu option without any
problems once you're done creating your codeplug.
