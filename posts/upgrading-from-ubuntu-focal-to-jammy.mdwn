A few weeks ago, I upgraded a few machines from Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) to
22.04 (jammy). Here are the things that needed fixing after the upgrade.

## Network problems

Firstly, I had to fix the resolution of `.local` domains the [same
way](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/upgrading-from-ubuntu-bionic-to-focal/#Network_problems)
as I did when I upgraded a different machine from 18.04 (bionic) to 20.04
(focal).

## ssh agent problems

Then, I found that `ssh-add` no longer worked and instead returned this error:

> Could not open connection to your authentication agent

While this appears to be a [known
issue](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/1922414), the
work-around suggested in the [i3
forum](https://github.com/i3/i3/discussions/5025) didn't work for me. What
did work was the solution described in [this blog
post](https://eklitzke.org/using-ssh-agent-and-ed25519-keys-on-gnome):

1. Add this to my `~/.bash_profile`:

       eval $(systemctl --user show-environment | grep SSH_AUTH_SOCK)
       export SSH_AUTH_SOCK

2. Add this to my [startup
   script](https://github.com/fmarier/user-scripts/blob/master/startup):

       /usr/bin/systemctl --user start ssh-agent.service

I'm not sure why ED25519 keys don't work in gnome-keyring since [that
bug](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=723274) was supposedly fixed
a while back, but starting `gnome-keyring-ssh.service` instead of
`ssh-agent.service` didn't work for me.

## Packges

When it comes to specific packages, I removed these two obsolete packages:

- `popularity-contest`
- `unattended-upgrades`

The former appears to no longer used by Ubuntu, while the latter is subsumed
by built-in systemd functionality:

    systemctl enable apt-daily-upgrade.timer
    systemctl start apt-daily-upgrade.timer

I also installed these two new packages:

- [`rng-tools5`](https://packages.debian.org/stable/rng-tools5) (a more modern version of [`rng-tools`](https://packages.debian.org/buster/rng-tools))
- [`exfatprogs`](https://packages.debian.org/stable/exfatprogs) (eliminates [`exfat-fuse`](https://packages.debian.org/stable/exfat-fuse)'s dependency on fuse)

As always, I put any packages I backport from Debian unstable into my
[PPA](https://launchpad.net/~fmarier/+archive/ubuntu/ppa?field.series_filter=jammy).
So far with jammy, I only had to update
[`tiger`](https://packages.debian.org/stable/tiger) to silence some bogus warnings.
