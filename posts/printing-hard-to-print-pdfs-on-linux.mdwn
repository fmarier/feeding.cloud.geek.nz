I recently found a few PDFs which I was unable to print due to
those files causing [insufficient printer memory
errors](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/model/9365402/document/c05049204):

I found a [detailed
explanation](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/71001/why-do-some-vector-graphics-included-into-a-document-force-rasterization-of-the#71050)
of what might be causing this which pointed the finger at transparent
images, a PDF 1.4 feature which apparently requires a more recent version of
[PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript) than what my printer
supports.

Using [Okular](https://okular.kde.org/)'s *Force rasterization* option
(accessible via the print dialog) does work by essentially rendering
everything ahead of time and outputing a big image to be sent to the
printer. The quality is not very good however.

# Converting a PDF to DjVu

The [best solution I found](https://superuser.com/a/1489923) makes use of a
different file format: [.djvu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DjVu)

Such files are not PDFs, but can still be opened in [Evince](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince) and
[Okular](https://okular.kde.org/), as well as in the dedicated
[DjVuLibre](http://djvu.sourceforge.net/) application.

As an example, I was unable to print page 11 of [this
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04049.pdf). Using `pdfinfo`, I found that
it is in PDF 1.5 format and so the transparency effects could be the cause
of the out-of-memory printer error.

Here's how I converted it to a high-quality DjVu file I could print without
problems using Evince:

    pdf2djvu -d 1200 2002.04049.pdf > 2002.04049-1200dpi.djvu

# Converting a PDF to PDF 1.3

I also tried the DjVu trick on a [different unprintable
PDF](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/113639/dead-winter-official-faq-v11),
but it failed to print, even after lowering the resolution to 600dpi:

    pdf2djvu -d 600 dow-faq_v1.1.pdf > dow-faq_v1.1-600dpi.djvu

In this case, I used a different technique and simply converted the PDF to
version 1.3 (from version 1.6 according to `pdfinfo`):

    ps2pdf13 -r1200x1200 dow-faq_v1.1.pdf dow-faq_v1.1-1200dpi.pdf

This eliminates the problematic transparency and rasterizes the elements
that version 1.3 doesn't support.
