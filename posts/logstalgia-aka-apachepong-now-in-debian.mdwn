Andrew Caudwell's [Logstalgia](http://code.google.com/p/logstalgia/) (aka ApachePong) has made it to [Debian](http://packages.qa.debian.org/l/logstalgia.html)! It's a fun little Apache access log viewer which replays old logs (or streams live ones) as an OpenGL pong game.  
  
So grab your favourite high-traffic access log and head over to the [download page](http://code.google.com/p/logstalgia/downloads/list) to check it out. There's also a [youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYYX-h4-dpM) if you can't find an interesting log file to use it with.
