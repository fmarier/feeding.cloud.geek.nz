Did you just tell the whole world how to attack your laptop?

I have provided ssh access with SixXS tunnels, but the ssh connections seem to drop after a while.  I've had other issues with the tunnels also, but I still use it to run a Bind9 hidden master.  

Recently I documented how to set up ssh through Tor with a stealth authentication cookie.  I think it's easier than signing up for a tunnel provider, perhaps setting up a firewall etc...  The latency of Tor can be a bit tedious for an interactive shell, but it works fine for our use cases.

Note if the https doesn't work, try http.  I have been testing some things and have nginx running port 443 and Apache on port 80 and I may break TLS as I try out some things.
