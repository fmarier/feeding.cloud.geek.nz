Here's how I created a restricted but *not ephemeral* guest account on an
Ubuntu 18.04 desktop computer that can be used without a password.

## Create a user that can login without a password

First of all, I created a new user with a random password (using `pwgen -s 64`):

    adduser guest

Then following [these
instructions](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2019/02/enable-passwordless-login-ubuntu-18-04/),
I created a new group and added the user to it:

    addgroup nopasswdlogin
    adduser guest nopasswdlogin

In order to let that user login using
[GDM](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GDM) without a password, I added the
following to the top of `/etc/pam.d/gdm-password`:

    auth    sufficient      pam_succeed_if.so user ingroup nopasswdlogin

Note that this user is unable to ssh into this machine since it's not part
of the [`sshuser` group I have setup in my sshd
configuration](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/hardening-ssh-servers/#Whitelist_approach_to_giving_users_ssh_access).

## Privacy settings

In order to reduce the amount of digital traces left between guest sessions,
I logged into the account using a GNOME session and then opened
gnome-control-center. I set the following in the privacy section:

Then I replaced Firefox with [Brave](https://brave.com/clo187) in the sidebar,
set it as the default browser in gnome-control-center:

and configured it to clear everything on exit:

## Create a password-less system keyring

In order to suppress [prompts to unlock
gnome-keyring](https://askubuntu.com/questions/867/how-can-i-stop-being-prompted-to-unlock-the-default-keyring-on-boot),
I opened [seahorse](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Seahorse) and deleted the
default keyring.

Then I started Brave, which prompted me to create a new keyring so that it
can save the contents of its password manager securely. I set an **empty
password** on that new keyring, since I'm not going to be using it.

I also made sure to disable saving of passwords, payment methods and
addresses in the browser too.

## Restrict user account further

Finally, taking an idea from this [similar
solution](https://askubuntu.com/a/19696/8368), I prevented the user from
making any system-wide changes by putting the following in
`/etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/10-guest-policy.pkla`:

    [guest-policy]
    Identity=unix-user:guest
    Action=*
    ResultAny=no
    ResultInactive=no
    ResultActive=no

If you know of any other restrictions that could be added, please leave a
comment!
