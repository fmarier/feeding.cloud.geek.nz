You don't want to use the noop IO scheduler. Turns out that cfq helps for SSDs as well; it will automatically avoid some of the heuristics that don't make sense on SSDs, but it will still provide a number of benefits.  
  
And while the 20% thing might make sense for cheap SSDs, the Intel SSDs will handle remapping just fine.
