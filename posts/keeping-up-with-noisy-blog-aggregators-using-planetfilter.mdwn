I follow a few blog aggregators (or "planets") and it's always a struggle to
keep up with the amount of posts that some of these get. The best strategy I
have found so far to is to filter them so that I remove the blogs I am not
interested in, which is why I wrote
[PlanetFilter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planetfilter).

## Other options

In my opinion, the first step in starting a new free software project should
be to look for a reason not to do it :) So I started by looking for
another approach and by asking people around me how they dealt with the
firehoses that are [Planet Debian](http://planet.debian.org) and
[Planet Mozilla](http://planet.mozilla.org).

It seems like a lot of people choose to "randomly sample" planet feeds and
only read a fraction of the posts that are sent through there. Personally
however, I find there are a lot of authors whose posts I never want to
miss so this option doesn't work for me.

A better option that other people have suggested is to avoid
subscribing to the planet feeds, but rather to subscribe to each of the
author feeds separately and prune them as you go. Unfortunately, this
*whitelist* approach is a high maintenance one since planets constantly add
and remove feeds. I decided that I wanted to follow a *blacklist* approach
instead.

## PlanetFilter

[PlanetFilter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planetfilter) is a local application
that you can configure to fetch your favorite planets and filter the posts
you see.

If you get it via [Debian](http://packages.debian.org/planetfilter) or
[Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/planetfilter), it comes with a
cronjob that looks at all configuration files in `/etc/planetfilter.d/` and
outputs filtered feeds in `/var/cache/planetfilter/`.

You can either:

* add `file:///var/cache/planetfilter/planetname.xml` to your local feed reader
* serve it locally (e.g. `http://localhost/planetname.xml`) using a
webserver, or
* host it on a server somewhere on the Internet.

The software will fetch new posts every hour and overwrite the local copy of
each feed.

A basic configuration file looks like this:

    [feed]
    url = http://planet.debian.org/atom.xml
    
    [blacklist]

## Filters

There are currently two ways of filtering posts out. The main one is by
author name:

    [blacklist]
    authors =
      Alice Jones
      John Doe

and the other one is by title:

    [blacklist]
    titles =
      This week in review
      Wednesday meeting for

In both cases, if a blog entry contains one of the blacklisted authors or
titles, it will be discarded from the generated feed.

## Tor support

Since blog updates happen asynchronously in the background, they can
[work very well over Tor](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/things-that-work-well-with-tor/).

In order to set that up in the Debian version of planetfilter:

1. Install the [tor](https://packages.debian.org/tor) and
   [polipo](https://packages.debian.org/polipo) packages.
2. Set the following in `/etc/polipo/config`:

        proxyAddress = "127.0.0.1"
        proxyPort = 8008
        allowedClients = 127.0.0.1
        allowedPorts = 1-65535
        proxyName = "localhost"
        cacheIsShared = false
        socksParentProxy = "localhost:9050"
        socksProxyType = socks5
        chunkHighMark = 67108864
        diskCacheRoot = ""
        localDocumentRoot = ""
        disableLocalInterface = true
        disableConfiguration = true
        dnsQueryIPv6 = no
        dnsUseGethostbyname = yes
        disableVia = true
        censoredHeaders = from,accept-language,x-pad,link
        censorReferer = maybe

3. Tell planetfilter to use the polipo proxy by adding the following to
   `/etc/default/planetfilter`:

        export http_proxy="localhost:8008"
        export https_proxy="localhost:8008"

## Bugs and suggestions

The source code is available on
[repo.or.cz](http://repo.or.cz/w/planetfilter.git).

I've been using this for over a month and it's been working quite well for
me. If you give it a go and run into any problems, please
[file a bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/planetfilter/+filebug)!

I'm also interested in any suggestions you may have.
