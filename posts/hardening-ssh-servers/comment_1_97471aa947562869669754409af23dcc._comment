You might enjoy [snoopy](https://packages.debian.org/snoopy) for logging purposes, since:

* It is contained in squeeze, wheezy, and jessie.
* It will log all commands.

The downside is that it won't log stdin, but I'd suggest that's almost a benefit since it avoids root-access users from seeing passwords.
