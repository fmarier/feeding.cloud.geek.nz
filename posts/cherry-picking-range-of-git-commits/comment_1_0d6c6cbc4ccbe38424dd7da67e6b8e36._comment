You have a mistake in your alias that got me confused at first: It's not "--pretty=oneline" but it's "--oneline" instead (or "--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit"). Otherwise you'll get the full commit IDs which are rather unhandy.  
  
Thanks for this helpful article, and even more for the useful alias. :)  
  
Enjoy!
