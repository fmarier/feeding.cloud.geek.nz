Mozilla has been promoting the idea of [lean
data](https://www.mozilla.org/about/policy/lean-data/) for a while. It's
about recognizing both that data is valuable and that it is a dangerous
thing to hold on to. Following these lean data principles forces you to
clarify the questions you want to answer and think hard about the minimal
set of information you need to answer these questions.

Out of these general principles came the [Firefox data collection
guidelines](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection). These are the
guidelines that every team must follow when they want to collect [data about
our users](https://data.firefox.com/) and that are enforced through the data
stewardship program.

As one of the data steward for Firefox, I have reviewed hundreds of data
collection requests and can attest to the fact that Mozilla does follow the
lean data principles it promotes. Mozillians are already aware of the
problems with collecting large amounts of data, but the Firefox data review
process provides an additional opportunity for an outsider to question the
necessity of each piece of data. In my experience, this system is quite
effective at reducing the data footprint of Firefox.

What does lean data look like in practice? Here are a few examples of
changes that were made to restrict the data collected by Firefox to what is
truly needed:

- Collecting a user's country is not particularly identifying in the case of
  large countries likes the USA, but it can be when it comes to very small
  island nations. How many Firefox users are there in
  [Niue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niue)? Hard to know, but it's
  definitely less than the number of Firefox users in Germany. After I
  raised that issue, the team decided to [put all of the small countries
  into a single "other"
  bucket](https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/pull/3877/commits/9a48cbec1cc1686758fec5cdfae5995f10918904).

- Similarly, cities generally have enough users to be non-identifying.
  However, some municipalities are quite small and can lead to the same
  problems. There are lots of Firefox users in [Portland,
  Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon) for example, but
  probably not that many in [Portland,
  Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Arkansas) or [Portland,
  Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Pennsylvania). If
  you want to tell the [Oregonian
  Portlanders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnVjkE87FDY) apart, it might
  be sufficient to bucket Portland users into "Oregon" and "not Oregon",
  instead of recording both the city and the state.

- When collecting window sizes and other pixel-based measurements, it's
  easier to collect the exact value. However, that exact value could be
  stable for a while and create a temporary
  [fingerprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint) for a
  user. In most cases, teams wanting to collect this kind of data have
  agreed to round the value in order to increase the number of users in each
  "bucket" without affecting their ability to answer their underlying
  questions.

- Firefox occasionally runs studies which involve collecting specific URLs
  that users have consented to share with us (e.g. "this site crashes my
  Firefox"). In most cases though, the full URL is not needed and so I have
  often been able to get teams to restrict the collection to the hostname,
  or to at least remove the query string, which could include username and
  passwords on badly-designed websites.

- When [making use of Google
  Analytics](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/01/google-analytics-privacy-and-event-tracking/),
  it may not be necessary to collect everything it supports by default. For
  example, my [suggestion to trim the
  referrers](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2579)
  was implemented by one of the teams using Google Analytics since while it
  would have been an interesting data point, it wasn't necessary to answer
  the questions they had in mind.

Some of these might sound like small wins, but to me they are a sign that
the process is working. In most cases, requests are
very easy to approve because developers have already done the hard work of
data minimization. In a few cases, by asking questions and getting familiar
with the problem, the data steward can point out opportunities for further
reductions in data collection that the team may have missed.
