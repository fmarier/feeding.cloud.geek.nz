Hi, I was using the Karmic > Lucid port of NUT which helped my server recognize my Belkin UPS.

I notice the NUT package is no longer available in your PPA. Do you know where I can find it? (or was the megatec_usb issue finally fixed in Lucid?)

Do you know if the Belkin UPS works ok with Precise?

Thanks in advance!
