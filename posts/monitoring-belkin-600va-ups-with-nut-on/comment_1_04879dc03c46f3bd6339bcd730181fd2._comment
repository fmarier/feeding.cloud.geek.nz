sadly, GPM (in fact UPower) will never talk to NUT directly. This was the way I was investigating with the nut-hal-drivers, but Richard (Hughes) doesn't want such bridges. At least, he thinks that UPower should only support standard units (the one supported by NUT's usbhid-ups driver). So you're stuck with NUT... For the GUI part, you should take a look at NUT Monitor (integrated in NUT, but still not packaged): http://www.lestat.st/informatique/projets/nut-monitor-en  
The last release includes a notification icon.
