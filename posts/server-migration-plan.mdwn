I recently had to migrate the main [Libravatar](https://www.libravatar.org) server to a new virtual
machine. In order to minimize risk and downtime, I decided to write a
[migration plan](http://zoompf.com/2013/08/you-need-a-website-migration-plan)
ahead of time.

I am sharing this plan here in case it gives any ideas to others who have to
go through a similar process.

# Prepare DNS

* Change the TTL on the DNS entry for `libravatar.org` to 3600 seconds.
* Remove the mirrors I don't control from the DNS load balancer (`cdn` and `seccdn`).
* Remove the main server from `cdn` and `seccdn` in DNS.

# Preparing the new server

* [Setup the new server](http://wiki.libravatar.org/setup_instructions/).
* Copy the database from the old site and restore it.
* Copy `/var/lib/libravatar` from the old site.
* Hack my local `/etc/hosts` file to point to the new server's IP address:

        xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx www.libravatar.org stats.libravatar.org cdn.libravatar.org

* Test all functionality on the new site.

# Preparing the old server

* Prepare a static "under migration" Apache config in `/etc/apache2/sites-enables.static/`:

        <VirtualHost *:80>
            RewriteEngine On
            RewriteRule ^ https://www.libravatar.org [redirect=301,last]
        </VirtualHost>

        <VirtualHost *:443>
            SSLEngine on
            SSLProtocol TLSv1
            SSLHonorCipherOrder On
            SSLCipherSuite RC4-SHA:HIGH:!kEDH
        
            SSLCertificateFile /etc/libravatar/www.crt
            SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/libravatar/www.pem
            SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/libravatar/www-chain.pem
        
            RewriteEngine On
            RewriteRule ^ /var/www/migration.html [last]
        
            <Directory /var/www>
                Allow from all
                Options -Indexes
            </Directory>
        </VirtualHost>

* Put this static file in /var/www/migration.html:

        <html>
        <body>
        <p>We are migrating to a new server. See you soon!</p>
        <p>- <a href="http://identi.ca/libravatar">@libravatar</a></p>
        </body>
        </html>

* Enable the rewrite module:

        a2enmod rewrite

* Prepare an Apache config proxying to the new server in `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled.proxy/`:

        <VirtualHost *:80>
            RewriteEngine On
            RewriteRule ^ https://www.libravatar.org [redirect=301,last]
        </VirtualHost>
        
        <VirtualHost *:443>
            SSLEngine on
            SSLProtocol TLSv1
            SSLHonorCipherOrder On
            SSLCipherSuite RC4-SHA:HIGH:!kEDH
        
            SSLCertificateFile /etc/libravatar/www.crt
            SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/libravatar/www.pem
            SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/libravatar/www-chain.pem
        
            SSLProxyEngine on
            ProxyPass / https://www.libravatar.org/
            ProxyPassReverse / https://www.libravatar.org/
        </VirtualHost>

* Enable the proxy-related modules for Apache:

        a2enmod proxy
        a2enmod proxy_connect
        a2enmod proxy_http

# Migrating servers

* [Tweet](https://twitter.com/libravatar/status/364659172983308288) and [dent](https://identi.ca/libravatar/note/UFBI9ne8SsOftkYlSKPHQQ) about the upcoming migration.

* Enable the static file config on the old server (disabling the Django app).

* Copy the database from the old server and restore it on the new server.
* Copy `/var/lib/libravatar` from the old server to the new one.

# Disable mirror sync

* Log into each mirror and comment out the sync cron jobs in `/etc/cron.d/libravatar-slave`.
* Make sure mirrors are no longer able to connect to the old server by deleting `/var/lib/libravatar/master/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the old server.

# Testing the main site

* Hack my local `/etc/hosts` file to point to the new server's IP address:

        xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx www.libravatar.org stats.libravatar.org cdn.libravatar.org

* Test all functionality on the new site.
* If testing is successful, update DNS to point to the new server with a short TTL (in case we need to revert).

* Enable the proxy config on the old server.
* Hack my local `/etc/hosts` file to point to the old server's IP address.
* Test basic functionality going through the proxy.
* Remove local `/etc/hosts/` hacks.

# Re-enable mirror sync

* Build a new `libravatar-slave` package with an updated `known_hosts` file for the new server.
* Log into each server I control and update that package.
* Test the connection to the master (hacking `/etc/hosts` on the mirror if needed):

        sudo -u libravatar-slave ssh libravatar-master@0.cdn.libravatar.org

* Uncomment the sync cron jobs in `/etc/cron.d/libravatar-slave`.
* An hour later, make sure that new images are copied over and that the TLS certs are still working.
* Remove `/etc/hosts` hacks from all mirrors.

# Post migration steps

* [Tweet](https://twitter.com/libravatar/status/364685629918949376) and [dent](https://identi.ca/libravatar/note/wIyaqgYjSu-ig_FDXLI8rA) about the fact that the migration was successful.
* Send a test email to the support address included in the tweet/dent.

* Take a backup of config files and data on the old server in case I forgot to copy something to the new one.

* Get in touch with mirror owners to tell them to update `libravatar-slave` package and test ssh configuration.
* Add third-party controlled mirrors back to the DNS load-balancer once they are up to date.

* A few days later, change the TTL for the main site back to 43200 seconds.
* A week later, kill the proxy on the old server by shutting it down.
