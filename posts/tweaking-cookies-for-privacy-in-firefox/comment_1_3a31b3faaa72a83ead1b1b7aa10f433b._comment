There are at least four choices:

* PrivacyBadger
* RequestPolicy
* Ghostery
* NoScript

and they all overlap in ways that are not clear to me. Do you have a recommendation for the best way to secure my privacy? Right now I use RP and NS, but I wonder what I am missing out not using PB or Ghostery.

Also, NS is prveenting e.g. use of Twitter and an ever-increasing number of sites, so it's not a long-term solution unless fixed.
