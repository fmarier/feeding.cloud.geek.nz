It depends how much inconvenience you're willing to tolerate :) At home, I use both [RequestPolicy Continued](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy-continued/) and [NoScript](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/). I quite like their block-everything-by-default approach.

On the other hand, at work, I don't have time for this so I use [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger).

I avoid Ghostery since it's [proprietary](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/license/5.4.9).
