Most people connect to Zoom via a [proprietary
client](https://zoom.us/download) which has been on the receiving end of a
number of [security and privacy
issues](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/zoom-security-privacy-woes) over the
past year, with some experts even describing it as
[malware](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/zoom-technology-security-coronavirus-video-conferencing).

It's not widely known however that Zoom offers a half-decent
[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) client which means cross-platform one-click
access to a Zoom room or webinar without needing to install any software.

**Given a Zoom link such as
`https://companyname.zoom.us/j/123456789?pwd=letmein`, you can use
`https://zoom.us/wc/join/123456789?pwd=letmein` to connect in your browser.**

Notice that the pool of Zoom room IDs is global and you can just drop the
`companyname` from the URL.

In my experience however, [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si) has much better
performance than Zoom's WebRTC client. For instance, I've never been able to
use Zoom successfully on a [Raspberry Pi
4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) (8GB), but
Jitsi works quite well. If you have a say in the choice of conference
platform, go with Jitsi instead.
