\"Once your devices are set to the right country, you should scan the local environment to pick the least congested wifi channel.\"

But beware -- the least congested channel may be unused for a reason.  In my office I can see the usual mess of overlapping wifi's but nobody uses 5/6/7.

And if you try you soon find out why -- something nearby emits huge amounts of noise at those frequencies and those channels just don't work at that location.

(Makes the \"auto select\" feature of many AP's useless).
