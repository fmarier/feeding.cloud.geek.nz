Even with a fully encrypted system (root and [swap](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/2008/03/encrypted-swap-partition-on.html) partitions), your data is still vulnerable while your computer is on. That's why [Bruce Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/blog/) recommends a [two-tier encryption strategy](http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/11/securitymatters_1129).
  
The idea is that infrequently used files are moved to a separate partition, encrypted with a different key. That way, the bulk of your data files is protected even if your laptop is [hijacked](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/02/hotplug_1.html) or if an intruder manages to steal some files while your main partition is decrypted.
  
On Debian and Ubuntu, a secure archive area can be created easily using an encrypted loopback partition and the `cryptmount` package.
  
Add this to `/etc/cryptmount/cmtab`:

    archives {
      dev=/home/francois/.archives
      dir=/home/francois/archives
      fstype=ext4
      fsoptions=defaults,noatime

      keyfile=/home/francois/.archives.key
      keyformat=builtin
      keyhash=sha512
      keycipher=aes-xts-plain64
      cipher=aes-xts-plain64
    }

Create the key and the 3GB loopback partition:

    sudo cryptmount --generate-key 32 archives
    sudo chown francois:francois .archives.key
    dd if=/dev/zero of=.archives bs=1G count=3
    mkdir archives
    sudo cryptmount --prepare archives
    sudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 /dev/mapper/archives
    sudo cryptmount --release archives

Fix the permissions so that you can write to this partition with your normal user account:

    cryptmount archives
    cd archives
    sudo chown francois:francois
    cryptmount -u archives

Then you can mount and umount that partition using:

    cryptmount archives

and:

    cryptmount -u archives
