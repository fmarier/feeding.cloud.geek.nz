Hello,
Thank you for this post which was very useful to me. I prefer this method which doesn't use pip to install dns challenge gandi plugin, just apt.
I also learned in the certbot documentation that you could combine a specific challenge with a specific automatic installation. For example if we have an Nginx server configured in http:

    sudo certbot --authenticator dns --installer nginx --dns-credentials /etc/letsencrypt/gandi.ini --dns-propagation-seconds 30 -d your.domain.tld

allows you to obtain a certificate and automatically configure the server in https.
