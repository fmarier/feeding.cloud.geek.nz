After upgrading my [MythTV](https://www.mythtv.org/) machine to Debian
[Bullseye](https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/) and [MythTV
31](https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Release_Notes_-_31), my Streamzap remote
control stopped working correctly: the up and down buttons were
working, but the OK button wasn't.

Here's the complete solution that made it work with the built-in kernel
support (i.e. without [LIRC](https://lirc.org/)).

## Button re-mapping

Since some of the buttons were working, but not others, I figured that the
buttons were probably not mapped to the right keys.

Inspired by these [old `v4l-utils`-based
instructions](https://github.com/graysky2/streamzap/tree/old#option-2---basic-operation-of-mplayer-using-only-the-v4l-utils-package),
I made my own custom keymap by by copying the original keymap:

    cp /lib/udev/rc_keymaps/streamzap.toml /etc/rc_keymaps/

and then modifying it to adapt it to what MythTV needs. This is what I ended
up with:

    \[[protocols]]
    name = "streamzap"
    protocol = "rc-5-sz"
    [protocols.scancodes]
    0x28c0 = "KEY_0"
    0x28c1 = "KEY_1"
    0x28c2 = "KEY_2"
    0x28c3 = "KEY_3"
    0x28c4 = "KEY_4"
    0x28c5 = "KEY_5"
    0x28c6 = "KEY_6"
    0x28c7 = "KEY_7"
    0x28c8 = "KEY_8"
    0x28c9 = "KEY_9"
    0x28ca = "KEY_ESC"
    0x28cb = "KEY_MUTE"
    0x28cc = "KEY_UP"
    0x28cd = "KEY_RIGHTBRACE"
    0x28ce = "KEY_DOWN"
    0x28cf = "KEY_LEFTBRACE"
    0x28d0 = "KEY_UP"
    0x28d1 = "KEY_LEFT"
    0x28d2 = "KEY_ENTER"
    0x28d3 = "KEY_RIGHT"
    0x28d4 = "KEY_DOWN"
    0x28d5 = "KEY_M"
    0x28d6 = "KEY_ESC"
    0x28d7 = "KEY_L"
    0x28d8 = "KEY_P"
    0x28d9 = "KEY_ESC"
    0x28da = "KEY_BACK"
    0x28db = "KEY_FORWARD"
    0x28dc = "KEY_R"
    0x28dd = "KEY_PAGEUP"
    0x28de = "KEY_PAGEDOWN"
    0x28e0 = "KEY_D"
    0x28e1 = "KEY_I"
    0x28e2 = "KEY_END"
    0x28e3 = "KEY_A"

Note that the keycodes can be found in the [kernel source
code](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/uapi/linux/input-event-codes.h).

With my own keymap in place at `/etc/rc_keymaps/streamzap.toml`, I changed
`/etc/rc_maps.cfg` to have the kernel driver automatically use it:

    --- a/rc_maps.cfg
    +++ b/rc_maps.cfg

     *      rc-tanix-tx3mini         tanix_tx3mini.toml

## Button repeat delay

To adjust the delay before button presses are repeated, I followed these
[old out-of-date
instructions](https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/User_Manual:IR_control_via_evdev#Modify_key_codes)
on the MythTV wiki and put the following in
`/etc/udev/rules.d/streamzap.rules`:

    ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0e9c", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0000", RUN+="/usr/bin/ir-keytable -s rc0 -D 1000 -P 250"

Note that the `-d` option has been replaced with `-s` in the latest version
of `ir-keytable`.

To check that the Streamzap is indeed detected as `rc0` on your system, use
this command:

    $ ir-keytable 
    Found /sys/class/rc/rc0/ with:
        Name: Streamzap PC Remote Infrared Receiver (0e9c:0000)
        Driver: streamzap
        Default keymap: rc-streamzap
    ...

Make sure you don't pass the `-c` to `ir-keytable` or else it will clear the
keymap set via `/etc/rc_maps.cfg`, removing all of the button mappings.
