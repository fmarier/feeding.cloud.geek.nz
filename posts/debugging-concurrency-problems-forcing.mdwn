Multi-threading can cause [hard-to-diagnose problems](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/01/threads-considered-harmful.html) and they are especially visible on multi-core CPUs (or multi-CPU systems) where threads actually run concurrently.  
  
Here's a quick way to find out if the segfaults you are experiencing might be due to some concurrency/locking problem: force the application to run on a single CPU using schedtool (part of the schedtool package on Debian/Ubuntu).  

    schedtool -a 0 -e applicationname

This is just one example of what you can do with the [CPU Affinity](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6799) controls on Linux.
