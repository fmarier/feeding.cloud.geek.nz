Thanks for dropping by Sjoerd. I was indeed hoping to be able to use Empathy (xmpp protocol) and to avoid writing a custom script.  
  
I saw that the tcp/udp traffic was going through the proxy server (I can almost swear it said "STUN") in the Empathy debugging window. I tried to get it to stop using that but I couldn't find any documentation as to which ports need to be opened/forwarded through NAT routers.  
  
I think it was using Theora but I'll try that x264 setting.
