Hi,

about network configuration on LXC in debian stretch, it is possible to easy the setup through the lxc-net script (it's shipped with-in the lxc package itself). This way you only need:

- to fill parameters in /etc/default/lxc-net
- add bridge configuration for lxcbr0 in /etc/network/interfaces

All of other steps pointed out in your \"Network setup\" are done by lxc-net itself.

The only downside of the script is that it would be nice to use, instead of a script, an horde of systemd units (if using systemd). I tried to fill a request for it [1] but it's still a work in progress.
