In my experience, git-cvsimport is the easiest and fastest way to import a CVS repo, as long as you don't care about whether or not the end result is correct. You might want to look at the ISSUES section of the manpage; in particular, it often cannot deal with branches correctly. (To be fair, this is partially a cvsps issue.)  
  
Me, I don't trust anything but cvs2git to import a CVS repo. I then use git-cvsimport to keep it up-to-date, but even then, I've seen it omit a couple of commits for no good reason, forcing me to re-import from scratch. (Of course, if you're moving away from CVS, you only need to get it right once.)  
  
If you choose to keep your initial import, don't blindly trust git-cvsimport. Compare the tip of every branch and every tag with a fresh CVS checkout, and take a close look at the history (gitk helps a lot). By its nature, Git makes it easy to fix mistakes at the start, but they'll be very hard to fix later on.  
  
Good luck!
