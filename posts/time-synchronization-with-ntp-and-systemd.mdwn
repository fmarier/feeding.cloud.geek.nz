I recently ran into problems with generating
[TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm)
2-factor codes on my laptop. The fact that some of the codes would work and
some wouldn't suggested a problem with time keeping on my laptop.

This was surprising since I've been running [NTP](http://www.ntp.org/) for a
many years and have therefore never had to think about time synchronization.
After looking into this though, I realized that the move to
[systemd](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) had changed how
this is meant to be done.

# The new systemd time synchronization daemon

On a machine running systemd, there is no need to run the full-fledged
`ntpd` daemon anymore. The built-in `systemd-timesyncd` can do the basic
time synchronization job just fine.

However, I noticed that the daemon wasn't actually running:

    $ systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service 
    ● systemd-timesyncd.service - Network Time Synchronization
       Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/systemd-timesyncd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
      Drop-In: /lib/systemd/system/systemd-timesyncd.service.d
               └─disable-with-time-daemon.conf
       Active: inactive (dead)
    Condition: start condition failed at Thu 2017-08-03 21:48:13 PDT; 1 day 20h ago
         Docs: man:systemd-timesyncd.service(8)

referring instead to a mysterious "failed condition". Attempting to restart
the service did provide more details though:

    $ systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service 
    $ systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service 
    ● systemd-timesyncd.service - Network Time Synchronization
       Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/systemd-timesyncd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
      Drop-In: /lib/systemd/system/systemd-timesyncd.service.d
               └─disable-with-time-daemon.conf
       Active: inactive (dead)
    Condition: start condition failed at Sat 2017-08-05 18:19:12 PDT; 1s ago
               └─ ConditionFileIsExecutable=!/usr/sbin/ntpd was not met
         Docs: man:systemd-timesyncd.service(8)

The above check for the presence of `/usr/sbin/ntpd` points to a conflict
between `ntpd` and `systemd-timesyncd`. The solution of course is to remove
the former before enabling the latter:

    apt purge ntp
    systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd.service
    systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service

# Enabling time synchronization with NTP

Once the `ntp` package has been removed, it is time to enable NTP support in
`timesyncd`.

Start by choosing the [NTP server pool](http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/) nearest
you and put it in `/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf`. For example, mine reads
like this:

    [Time]
    NTP=ca.pool.ntp.org

before restarting the daemon:

    systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service 

That may not be enough on your machine though. To check whether or not the
time has been synchronized with NTP servers, run the following:

    $ timedatectl status
    ...
     Network time on: yes
    NTP synchronized: no
     RTC in local TZ: no

If NTP is not enabled, then you can enable it by running this command:

    timedatectl set-ntp true

Once that's done, everything should be in place and time should be kept
correctly:

    $ timedatectl status
    ...
     Network time on: yes
    NTP synchronized: yes
     RTC in local TZ: no
