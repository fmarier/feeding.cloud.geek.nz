First, hats off to FF for doing such a great job for us non-tech citizens.  I don't understand why anyone would ever trust a pro-data-use browser like edge or chrome.  Happy to have made small annual contributions to Mozilla the last two years.
Now, in my Win 10 Pro 64-bit event view error messages, I have an entry that \"Name resolution for the name shavar.services.mozilla.com timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded.\"
But from this article, I suppose there's nothing to worry about because shavar updates every hour, and this one line is probably just a glitch.  Some electron somewhere had to run to the bathroom for five minutes?
Thanks.
