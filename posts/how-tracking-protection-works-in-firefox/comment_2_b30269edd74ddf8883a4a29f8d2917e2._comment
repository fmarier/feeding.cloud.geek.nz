> I have an entry that \"Name resolution for the name shavar.services.mozilla.com timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded.\" But from this article, I suppose there's nothing to worry about because shavar updates every hour, and this one line is probably just a glitch.

It's hard to say what went wrong, but I wouldn't worry about it because Firefox will keep using the old list as long as it can't reach the server.
