Up until recently, it was a pain to defend againt [WPA2 brute-force
attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access#Weak_password)
by using a random 63-character password (the maximum in
[WPA-Personal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access#Target_users_(authentication_key_distribution))
mode). Thanks to Android 10 and iOS 11 supporting reading WiFi passwords
from a QR code, this is finally a practical defense.

## Generating the QR code

After installing the [`qrencode`](https://packages.debian.org/stable/qrencode)
package, run the following:

    qrencode -o wifi.png "WIFI:T:WPA;S:<SSID>;P:<PASSWORD>;;"

substituting `<SSID>` for the name of your WiFi network and `<PASSWORD>` for
the 63-character password you hopefully generated with `pwgen -s 63`.

The only pitfall I ran into is that if you include a trailing newline character (for example piping
`echo "..."` into `qrencode` as opposed to `echo -n "..."`) then it will
fail on both iOS and Android.

## Scanning the QR code

On iOS, simply open the camera app and scan the QR code to bring up a
notification which allows you to connect to the WiFi network:

On Android, go into the WiFi settings and tap on the WiFi network you want
to join:

then click the QR icon in the password field and scan the code:

## In-browser alternative

If you can't do this locally for some reason, there is also an [in-browser
QR code generator](https://qifi.org/) with [source code
available](https://github.com/evgeni/qifi).
