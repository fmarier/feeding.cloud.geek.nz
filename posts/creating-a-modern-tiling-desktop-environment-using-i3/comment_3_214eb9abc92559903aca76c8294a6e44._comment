Hi!

`gnome-screensaver` does not work as expected because idleness is detected by `gnome-session`. You could run i3 through `gnome-session` (you need an hand-crafted desktop file).

For switching between keyboard bindings, this is something that X can handle itself. For example, look at `setxkbmap us,fr '' grp:rctrl_rshift_toggle` will switch between US and FR layouts.

I had tried to keep those gnome stuff in the past, but the interaction between all those parts is under-documented and can change quite often. I would stay far from gnome-settings-daemon which does a lot of things. You could look at `xsettingsd` which will do exactly what you describe without hidden features.
