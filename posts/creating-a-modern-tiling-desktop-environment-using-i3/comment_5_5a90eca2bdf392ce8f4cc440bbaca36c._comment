I should probably blog about my use of git-annex at some point :)

Setting it up is not hard if you use the assistant (`git annex webapp`). I use my own ssh server as the intermediate transfer server and I set up an XMPP server on there too.

For /etc however, I use the `etckeeper` package instead.
