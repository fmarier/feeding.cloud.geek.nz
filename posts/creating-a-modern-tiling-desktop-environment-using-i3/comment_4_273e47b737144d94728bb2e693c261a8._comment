The ion3 has a fork Notion (http://notion.sourceforge.net/) which not only is actively mantained (and has a fair progress since forking, like new kludges and xrandr/xinerama-no-restart support) but also is properly licensed and is a part of Debian (at least testing, which I'm on). I use it on a daily basis. There's hardly an need for ion-addicts to reinvent the wheel...
