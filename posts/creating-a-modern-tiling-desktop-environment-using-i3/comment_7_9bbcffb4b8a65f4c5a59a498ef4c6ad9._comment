Thanks for your comments Vincent, it's good to hear from someone who seems to know what's going on :)

I've tried your `setxkbmap` line and the toggle doesn't work. I suspect these issues on jessie/sid are the same as what these other users have found on Ubuntu 14.04:

* <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24055428/setxkbmap-toggle-doesnt-work>

It would also explain why the toggle doesn't work in the GNOME settings (since it's probably just calling `setxkbmap` for us).
