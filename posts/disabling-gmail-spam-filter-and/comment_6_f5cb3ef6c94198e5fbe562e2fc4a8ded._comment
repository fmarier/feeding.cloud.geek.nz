I too have an unmanageable amount of spam in my Gmail spam folder. Having to scan a thousand messages a day for possibly 1 or 2 that isn't spam is quite annoying.  
  
I came upon this script to allow me to use spamassassin and still read my mail using the gmail interface.

I run it on my [Gmail]/Spam folder instead of the Inbox
