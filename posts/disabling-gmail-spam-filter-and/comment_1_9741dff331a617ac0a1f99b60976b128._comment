The easier way to do this is to create a Gmail Filter.  
  
1. Set up a new filter.  
  
2. Add to the "Has the Words" field "is:spam"  
  
3. Click the "Next Step" button, disregard any warning messages.  
  
4. Check the boxes "Skip the inbox" and "Delete it".  
  
5. Save the filter.  
  
Now any items that would hit the Spam folder go directly to Trash and are automatically deleted in 30 days.
