> In the instruction you say turn on the radio. How do you do that if it is locked and can be only unlocked by programing?

The radio being factory-locked shouldn't prevent you from turning it on using the right knob. If you're talking about the keypad being locked, then yes that's one of the things that can be [unlocked using the CPS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzFqEM-yC7A).
