I am so excited that I now have a \"Safe\" way to run Windows for devices that do not support Linux.  I walked away from all MS products in favor of Linux over a decade ago.  I love that VM gives you full control over what resources Windows can see.  I can download under linux and drag and drop onto the Windows VM and Windows will never have access to the internet.  Thank you for your very detailed instructions.  This has opened up many devices for me that are not supported under Linux.
