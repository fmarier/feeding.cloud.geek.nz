Here is the daily/weekly cronjob I put together over the years to perform
[MythTV](https://www.mythtv.org)-related maintenance tasks on my backend
server.

The first part performs a [database backup](https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/User_Manual:Periodic_Maintenance#The_database):

    5 1 * * *  mythtv  /usr/share/mythtv/mythconverg_backup.pl

which I previously configured by putting the following in `/home/mythtv/.mythtv/backuprc`:

    DBBackupDirectory=/var/backups/mythtv

and creating a new directory for it:

    mkdir /var/backups/mythtv
    chown mythtv:mythtv /var/backups/mythtv

The second part of `/etc/cron.d/mythtv-maintenance` runs a contrib script to [optimize the database
tables](https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/User_Manual:Periodic_Maintenance#Optimize_the_Database):

    10 1 * * *  mythtv  /usr/bin/chronic /usr/share/doc/mythtv-backend/contrib/maintenance/optimize_mythdb.pl

once a day. It requires the `libmythtv-perl` and `libxml-simple-perl` packages
to be installed on Debian-based systems.

It is quickly followed by a check of the recordings and [automatic repair of
the seektable](https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Repairing_the_Seektable) (when possible):

    20 1 * * *  mythtv  /usr/bin/chronic /usr/bin/mythutil --checkrecordings --fixseektable

Next, I force a scan of the music and video databases to pick up anything new
that may have been added externally via
[NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) mounts:

    30 1 * * *  mythtv  /usr/bin/mythutil --quiet --scanvideos
    31 1 * * *  mythtv  /usr/bin/mythutil --quiet --scanmusic

Finally, I [defragment the XFS
partition](https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Optimizing_Performance#XFS-Specific_Tips)
for two hours every day except Friday:

    45 1 * * 1-4,6-7  root  /usr/sbin/xfs_fsr

and resync the
[RAID-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_1) arrays
once a week to ensure that they stay consistent and error-free:

    15 3 * * 2  root  /usr/local/sbin/raid_parity_check md0
    15 3 * * 4  root  /usr/local/sbin/raid_parity_check md2

using a [trivial
script](https://github.com/fmarier/root-scripts/blob/master/raid_parity_check).

In addition to that cronjob, I also have
[smartmontools](https://packages.debian.org/stable/smartmontools) run daily
short and weekly long [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.)
tests via this blurb in `/etc/smartd.conf`:

    /dev/sda -a -d ata -o on -S on -s (S/../.././04|L/../../6/05)
    /dev/sdb -a -d ata -o on -S on -s (S/../.././04|L/../../6/05)

server, please leave a comment!
