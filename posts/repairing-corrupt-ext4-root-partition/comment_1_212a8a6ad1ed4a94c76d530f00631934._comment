Hi. Two things you might want to check, if you haven't already.

See if the \"UDMA_CRC_Error_Count\" or \"CRC_Error_Count\" attribute (199) reported by your smartctl is >0 and slowly increasing over time. It's not marked as an error by smartctl and it's easy to miss. It's an indication of a flaky SATA bus connection and I've seen this cause filesystem corruption (I'm guessing because every once in a while CRC will randomly end up OK for a corrupted command).

The other thing is to check if you're running \"fstrim\". Some SSDs are known to have bugs with that and you might be running a kernel that doesn't yet have a workaround or blacklist for your particular model or SSD firmware version. See [[https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/ata/libata-core.c#L3774]].
