I ran into what seemed to be a DNS problem when building a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container:

    Err http://archive.ubuntu.com jammy Release.gpg
      Could not resolve 'archive.ubuntu.com'
    
    W: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/jammy/Release.gpg  Could not resolve 'archive.ubuntu.com'
    
    W: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.


I found that [many solutions](https://robinwinslow.uk/fix-docker-networking-dns) talked about
setting the default DNS server explicitly in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

    {
        "dns": ["1.1.1.1"]
    }

but that didn't work for me.

I noticed however that I was having these problems whenever I connected to my VPN.
So what did work for me was **restarting the docker daemon whenever
there is a change in networking** (e.g. enabling/disabling VPN) by putting the
following in `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/docker-local`:

    #!/bin/sh
    
    LOGFILE=/var/log/docker-restarts.log
    
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "$0: called with no interface" >> $LOGFILE
        exit 1;
    fi
    
    if [ "$1" = lo ]; then
        # Ignoring the loopback interface
        exit 0;
    fi
    
    case "$2" in
        up|vpn-up|down|vpn-down)
            echo "$0: restarting docker due to action \`$2' on interface \`$1'" >> $LOGFILE
            /bin/systemctl restart docker.service
            ;;
        *)
            echo "$0: ignoring action \`$2' on interface \`$1'" >> $LOGFILE
            ;;
    esac

and then making that new file executable:

    chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/docker-local

You can confirm that it's working as intended by watching the logs:

    tail -f /var/log/docker-restarts.log

while enabling/disable your VPN or your network connection. If you don't see
any output, then something is wrong and the Docker restart isn't happening.
