I manage a few servers for myself, [friends and
family](https://speakerdeck.com/fmarier/supporting-debian-machines-for-friends-and-family-1)
as well as for the [Libravatar](https://www.libravatar.org) project. Here is
how I customize recent releases of Debian on those servers.

# Hardware tests

    apt install memtest86+ smartmontools e2fsprogs

Prior to spending any time configuring a new physical server, I like to
ensure that the hardware is fine.

To check memory, I boot into memtest86+ from the grub menu and let it run
overnight.

Then I check the hard drives using:

    smartctl -t long /dev/sdX
    badblocks -swo badblocks.out /dev/sdX

# Configuration

    apt install etckeeper git sudo vim

To keep track of the configuration changes I make in `/etc/`, I use etckeeper
to keep that directory in a git repository and make the following changes to
the default `/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf`:

- turn off daily auto-commits
- turn off auto-commits before package installs

To get more control over the various packages I install, I change the
default debconf level to medium:

    dpkg-reconfigure debconf

Since I use vim for all of my configuration file editing, I make it the
default editor:

    update-alternatives --config editor

and I turn on syntax highlighting and visual beeping globally by adding the
following to `/etc/vim/vimrc.local`:

    syntax on
    set background=dark
    set visualbell

# ssh

    apt install openssh-server mosh fail2ban

Since most of my servers are set to UTC time, I like to [use my local
timezone](http://petereisentraut.blogspot.com/2012/04/setting-time-zone-on-remote-ssh-hosts.html)
when sshing into them. Looking at file timestamps is much less
confusing that way.

I also ensure that the locale I use is available on the server by adding it
the list of generated locales:

    dpkg-reconfigure locales

Make sure the default locale is **using the UTF-8** encoding since that will
ensure that things like Postgres default to the One True Encoding when you
install/bootstrap them.

Other than that, I [harden the ssh configuration](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/hardening-ssh-servers/)
and end up with the following settings in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (jessie):

    HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
    HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
    HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
 
    KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256
    Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr
    MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,umac-128@openssh.com
 
    UsePrivilegeSeparation sandbox

    AuthenticationMethods publickey
    PasswordAuthentication no
    PermitRootLogin no

    AcceptEnv LANG LC_* TZ
    AllowGroups sshuser

On those servers where I need [duplicity/paramiko to
work](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/509), I also add the following:

    KexAlgorithms ...,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
    MACs ...,hmac-sha1

Since [fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/) is used to rate-limit attempts to
brute-force ssh connections, you may want to whitelist your own IP addresses
by adding them to `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/local.conf`:

    [DEFAULT]
    ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 1.2.3.4

Then I remove the "Accepted" filter in `/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server/ssh`
(first line) to get a notification whenever anybody successfully logs into
my server.

I also create a new group and add the users that need ssh access to it:

    addgroup sshuser
    adduser francois sshuser

and add a timeout for root sessions by putting this in `/root/.bash_profile`:

    TMOUT=600

# Security checks

    apt install logcheck logcheck-database fcheck tiger debsums systemd-coredump mcelog rkhunter
    apt remove --purge john john-data rpcbind tripwire unhide unhide.rb

Logcheck is the main tool I use to keep an eye on log files, which is why I
add a few additional log files to the default list in
`/etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles`:

    /var/log/apache2/error.log
    /var/log/mail.err
    /var/log/mail.warn
    /var/log/mail.info
    /var/log/fail2ban.log

while ensuring that the apache logfiles are readable by logcheck:

    chmod a+rx /var/log/apache2
    chmod a+r /var/log/apache2/*

and fixing the log rotation configuration by adding the following to
`/etc/logrotate.d/apache2`:

    create 644 root adm

I usually create these empty files to silence logcheck errors:

    touch /var/log/mail.{err,warn}
    chown root:adm /var/log/mail.{err,warn}

I also modify the main logcheck configuration file
(`/etc/logcheck/logcheck.conf`):

    INTRO=0
    FQDN=0

Other than that, I enable daily checks in `/etc/default/debsums` and
customize a few tiger settings in `/etc/tiger/tigerrc`:

    Tiger_Check_RUNPROC=Y
    Tiger_Check_DELETED=Y
    Tiger_Check_APACHE=Y
    Tiger_FSScan_WDIR=Y
    Tiger_SSH_Protocol='2'
    Tiger_Passwd_Hashes='sha512'
    Tiger_Running_Procs='rsyslogd cron /usr/sbin/apache2 postgres'
    Tiger_Listening_ValidProcs='sshd|mosh-server|ntpd'

I also add these to `/etc/fcheck/fcheck.local.cfg`:

    Directory      = /var/www
    
    Exclusion      = /etc/.git/
    Exclusion      = /etc/.etckeeper
    Exclusion      = /etc/.gitignore
    Exclusion      = /etc/mtab

and these to `/etc/rkhunter.conf.local`:

    ALLOWHIDDENDIR=/etc/.git
    ALLOWHIDDENFILE=/etc/.etckeeper
    ALLOWHIDDENFILE=/etc/.gitignore
    
    ALLOWDEVFILE=/dev/shm/logcheck.*
    ALLOWDEVFILE=/dev/shm/logcheck.*/ignore/*
    ALLOWDEVFILE=/dev/shm/logcheck.*/violations/*
    ALLOWDEVFILE=/dev/shm/logcheck.*/violations-ignore/*
    ALLOWDEVFILE=/dev/shm/logcheck.*/cracking/*
    ALLOWDEVFILE=/dev/shm/logcheck.*/logoutput/*
    ALLOWDEVFILE=/dev/shm/logcheck.*/logoutput-sorted
    ALLOWDEVFILE=/dev/shm/logcheck.*/checked
    ALLOWDEVFILE=/dev/shm/PostgreSQL.*

# General hardening

    apt install apparmor apparmor-profiles apparmor-profiles-extra libpam-tmpdir

While the harden packages are configuration-free, AppArmor must be [manually enabled](https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/HowToUse#Enable_AppArmor):

    perl -pi -e 's,GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="(.*)"$,GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="$1 apparmor=1 security=apparmor",' /etc/default/grub
    update-grub

In addition, certain kernel security features can be enabled by putting the
following in `/etc/sysctl.d/local.conf` to
[hide kernel pointers and messages](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt)
from unprivileged processes:

    kernel.dmesg_restrict = 1
    kernel.kptr_restrict = 1

and the following to harden the TCP stack:

    net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
    net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
    net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
    net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1
    net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1

before reloading these settings using `sysctl -p`.

# Entropy and timekeeping

    apt install rng-tools chrony

To keep the system clock accurate and increase the amount of entropy
available to the server, I install the above packages and add the `tpm_rng`
module to `/etc/modules`.

I also set the server timezone to **UTC** using `dpkg-reconfigure tzdata`.

# Preventing mistakes

    apt install molly-guard safe-rm sl

The above packages are all about catching mistakes (such as
[accidental deletions](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/preventing-accidental-deletion-of/)).

# Package updates

    apt install apticron unattended-upgrades deborphan debfoster apt-listchanges reboot-notifier popularity-contest needrestart debian-security-support

These tools help me keep packages up to date and remove unnecessary or
obsolete packages from servers. On Rackspace servers, a small [configuration
change](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/using-unattended-upgrades-on-rackspace-debian-ubuntu-servers/)
is needed to automatically update the monitoring tools.

On jessie or later, I install
[reboot-notifier](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/introducing-reboot-notifier/)
to send me a notification whenever a kernel update requires a reboot to take
effect.

In addition to knowing when you need to reboot your machine, the
`needrestart` package will let you know (and offer to do it for you) when
you need to restart a daemon using an obsolete library.

# Handy utilities

    apt install renameutils atool iotop sysstat lsof mtr-tiny mc netcat-openbsd command-not-found nocache

Most of these tools are configuration-free, except for sysstat, which requires
enabling data collection in `/etc/default/sysstat` to be useful.

Also, [`command-not-found` won't work until you update the apt cache](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=857090):

    apt update
    update-command-not-found

# Apache configuration

    apt install apache2
    a2enmod mpm_event

While configuring apache is often specific to each server and the services
that will be running on it, there are a few common changes I make.

I enable these in `/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf`:

    <Directory />
        AllowOverride None
        Require all denied
    </Directory>
    ServerTokens Prod
    ServerSignature Off

I also create a new `/etc/apache2/conf-available/servername.conf` which contains:

    ServerName machine_hostname.example.com

and then run:

    a2enconf servername

# Mail

    apt install postfix
    apt purge exim4-base exim4-daemon-light exim4-config

Configuring mail properly is tricky but the following has worked for me.

In `/etc/hostname`, put the bare hostname (no domain), but in
`/etc/mailname` put the fully qualified hostname.

In `/etc/hosts`, make sure that the fully qualified hostname is the
first alias for `127.0.0.1`, followed by the bare hostname and then
anything else. For example:

    127.0.0.1 hostname.example.com hostname localhost

Change the following in `/etc/postfix/main.cf`:

    inet_interfaces = loopback-only
    myhostname = (fully qualified hostname)
    smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP
    smtp_tls_security_level = may
    smtp_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3

Set the following aliases in `/etc/aliases`:

- set `francois` as the destination of `root` emails
- set an external email address for `francois`
- set `root` as the destination for `www-data` emails

before running `newaliases` to update the aliases database.

Create a new cronjob (`/etc/cron.hourly/checkmail`):

    #!/bin/sh
    ls /var/mail

to ensure that email doesn't accumulate unmonitored on this box.

Finally, set reverse DNS for the server's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and then
test the whole setup using `mail root`.

To monitor that mail never stops flowing, add this machine to a free
[healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io) account and create a
`/etc/cron.d/healthchecks-io` cronjob:

    0 1 * * * root echo "ping" | mail xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx@hchk.io

# Network tuning

To [reduce the server's contribution to
bufferbloat](https://lwn.net/Articles/616241/) I change the default kernel
queueing discipline (jessie or later) by putting the following in `/etc/sysctl.d/local.conf`:

    net.core.default_qdisc=fq_codel

[[!tag sysadmin]] [[!tag debian]] [[!tag nzoss]]
