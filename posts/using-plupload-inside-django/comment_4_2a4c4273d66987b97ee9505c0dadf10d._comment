Hello,  
  
I have been testing you django plupload integration and it works nice... could you talk a bit more about the secure temp_file issue?  
If I simple do a  
  
file_obj, temp_file = tempfile.mkstemp()  
  
it does not work as it creates a multiple tempfiles for an upload?  
Do you have a hint on how to go about this?  
  
thanks  
Titusz
