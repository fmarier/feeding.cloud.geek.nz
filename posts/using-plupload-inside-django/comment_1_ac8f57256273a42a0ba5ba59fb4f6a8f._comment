Hi Francois,  
  
Question of the year: After the completed download I want a redirection to take place, do I have to hook in some JS event? I ask because the else statement of request.is_ajax() seems to never be executed. Unless I am doing something horribly wrong which might very well be :)  
  
thanks and regards,  
Michele
