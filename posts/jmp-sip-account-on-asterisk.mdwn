[JMP](https://jmp.chat/) offers VoIP calling via [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP), but it's also
possibly to use the VoIP using [SIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol).

The underlying VoIP calling functionality in JMP is provided by
[Bandwidth](https://www.bandwidth.com/), but their [old Asterisk
instructions](https://web.archive.org/web/20101226183140/http://www.bandwidth.com/wiki/article/Configuring_Asterisk_for_bandwidth.com)
didn't quite work for me. Here's how I set it up in my [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/) server.

# Get your SIP credentials

After signing up for JMP and setting it up in your favourite XMPP client,
send the following message to the `cheogram.com` gateway contact:

    reset sip account

In response, you will receive a message containing:

- a numerical username
- a password (e.g. three lowercase words separated by spaces)

# Add SIP account to your Asterisk config

First of all, I added the following to my `/etc/asterisk/pjsip.conf`:

    [transport-udp]
    type = transport
    protocol = udp
    bind = 0.0.0.0
    external_media_address = myasterisk.dyn.example.com
    external_signaling_address = myasterisk.dyn.example.com
    local_net = 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0

    [jmp]
    type = registration
    contact_user = 5554561000
    transport = transport-udp
    outbound_auth = jmp
    client_uri = sip:5554561000@jmp.cbcbc7.auth.bandwidth.com:5008
    server_uri = sip:jmp.cbcbc7.auth.bandwidth.com:5008
    
    [jmp]
    type = auth
    password = three secret words
    username = 5554561000
    
    [jmp]
    type = aor
    contact = sip:5554561000@jmp.cbcbc7.auth.bandwidth.com:5008
    
    [jmp]
    type = identify
    endpoint = jmp
    match = jmp.cbcbc7.auth.bandwidth.com
    
    [jmp]
    type = endpoint
    context = from-jmp
    dtmf_mode = rfc4733
    disallow = all
    allow = ulaw
    allow = g729
    auth = jmp
    outbound_auth = jmp
    aors = jmp
    rtp_symmetric = yes
    rewrite_contact = yes
    send_rpid = yes

and for reference, here's the blurb for my [Snom 300](https://service.snom.com/display/wiki/User+Manuals?preview=%2F48399335%2F48399359%2FUM_snom3xx_V2.2_en.pdf) SIP phone:

    [2000]
    type = aor
    max_contacts = 1
    
    [2000]
    type = auth
    username = 2000
    password = password123
    
    [2000]
    type = endpoint
    context = full
    dtmf_mode = rfc4733
    disallow = all
    allow = g722
    allow = ulaw
    mailboxes = 10@internal
    auth = 2000
    outbound_auth = 2000
    aors = 2000

I checked that the registration was successful by running `asterisk -r` and
then typing:

    pjsip set logger on

before reloading the configuration using:

    reload

# Create Asterisk extensions to send and receive calls

Once I got registration to work, I hooked this up with my other extensions
so that I could send and receive calls using my JMP number.

In `/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf`, I added the following:

    [from-jmp]
    include => home
    exten => s,1,Goto(2000,1)

where `home` is the context which includes my local SIP devices and `2000`
is the extension I want to ring.

Then I added the following to enable calls to any destination within the
[North American Numbering Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan):

    [pstn-jmp]
    exten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,1,Set(CALLERID(all)=Francois Marier <username>)
    exten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,n,Dial(PJSIP/${EXTEN}@jmp)
    exten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,n,Hangup()
    exten => _NXXNXXXXXX,1,Set(CALLERID(all)=Francois Marier <username>)
    exten => _NXXNXXXXXX,n,Dial(PJSIP/1${EXTEN}@jmp)
    exten => _NXXNXXXXXX,n,Hangup()

Here `username` is my bwsip numerical username. When calls are placed, this gets
automatically swapped in by my real JMP phone number, but Bandwidth appears to
**require its users to use their username in there caller ID string**.

For reference, here's the rest of my dialplan in `/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf`:

    [general]
    static=yes
    writeprotect=no
    clearglobalvars=no
    
    [public]
    exten => _X.,1,Hangup(3)
    
    [sipdefault]
    exten => _X.,1,Hangup(3)
    
    [default]
    exten => _X.,1,Hangup(3)
    
    [internal]
    include => home
    
    [full]
    include => internal
    include => pstn-jmp
    exten => 707,1,VoiceMailMain(10@internal)
    
    [home]
    exten => 2000,1,Dial(PJSIP/2000,20)
    exten => 2000,n,Goto(in2000-${DIALSTATUS},1)
    exten => 2000,n,Hangup
    exten => in2000-BUSY,1,VoiceMail(10@internal,su)
    exten => in2000-BUSY,n,Hangup
    exten => in2000-CONGESTION,1,VoiceMail(10@internal,su)
    exten => in2000-CONGESTION,n,Hangup
    exten => in2000-CHANUNAVAIL,1,VoiceMail(10@internal,su)
    exten => in2000-CHANUNAVAIL,n,Hangup
    exten => in2000-NOANSWER,1,VoiceMail(10@internal,su)
    exten => in2000-NOANSWER,n,Hangup
    exten => _in2000-.,1,Hangup(16)

# Firewall

Finally, I opened a few ports in my firewall by putting the following in
`/etc/network/iptables.up.rules`:

    # SIP and RTP on UDP (jmp.cbcbc7.auth.bandwidth.com)
    -A INPUT -s 67.231.2.13/32 -p udp --dport 5008 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -s 216.82.238.135/32 -p udp --dport 5008 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -s 67.231.2.13/32 -p udp --sport 5004:5005 --dport 10001:20000 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -s 216.82.238.135/32 -p udp --sport 5004:5005 --dport 10001:20000 -j ACCEPT
