[JMP](https://jmp.chat/) offers VoIP calling via [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP), but it's also
possibly to use the VoIP using [SIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol).

The underlying VoIP calling functionality in JMP is provided by
[Bandwidth](https://www.bandwidth.com/), but their [old Asterisk
instructions](https://web.archive.org/web/20101226183140/http://www.bandwidth.com/wiki/article/Configuring_Asterisk_for_bandwidth.com)
didn't quite work for me. Here's how I set it up in my [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/) server.

# Get your SIP credentials

After signing up for JMP and setting it up in your favourite XMPP client,
send the following message to the `cheogram.com` gateway contact:

    reset sip account

In response, you will receive a message containing:

- a numerical username
- a password (e.g. three lowercase words separated by spaces)

# Add SIP account to your Asterisk config

First of all, I added the following near the top of my
`/etc/asterisk/sip.conf`:

    [general]
    register => username:three secret words@jmp.cbcbc7.auth.bandwidth.com:5008

Note that you can have more than one `register` line in your config if you
use more than one SIP provider, but **you must register with the server
whether you want to receive incoming calls or not**.

Then I added a new blurb to the bottom of the same file:

    [jmp]
    type=peer
    host=mp.cbcbc7.auth.bandwidth.com
    port=5008
    secret=three secret words
    defaultuser=username
    context=from-jmp
    disallow=all
    allow=ulaw
    allow=g729
    insecure=port,invite
    canreinvite=no
    dtmfmode=rfc2833

I checked that the registration was successful by running `asterisk -r` and
then typing:

    sip set debug on

before reloading the configuration using:

    reload

# Create Asterisk extensions to send and receive calls

Once I got registration to work, I hooked this up with my other extensions
so that I could send and receive calls using my JMP number.

In `/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf`, I added the following:

    [from-jmp]
    include => home
    exten => s,1,Goto(1000,1)

where `home` is the context which includes my local SIP devices and `1000`
is the extension I want to ring.

Then I added the following to enable calls to any destination within the
[North American Numbering Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan):

    [pstn-jmp]
    exten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,1,Set(CALLERID(all)=Francois Marier <5551231434>)
    exten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,n,Dial(SIP/jmp/${EXTEN})
    exten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,n,Hangup()
    exten => _NXXNXXXXXX,1,Set(CALLERID(all)=Francois Marier <5551231234>)
    exten => _NXXNXXXXXX,n,Dial(SIP/jmp/1${EXTEN})
    exten => _NXXNXXXXXX,n,Hangup()

Here `5551231234` is my JMP phone number, not my bwsip numerical username.

# Firewall

Finally, I opened a few ports in my firewall by putting the following in
`/etc/network/iptables.up.rules`:

    # SIP and RTP on UDP (jmp.cbcbc7.auth.bandwidth.com)
    -A INPUT -s 67.231.2.13/32 -p udp --dport 5008 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -s 216.82.238.135/32 -p udp --dport 5008 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -s 67.231.2.13/32 -p udp --sport 5004:5005 --dport 10001:20000 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -s 216.82.238.135/32 -p udp --sport 5004:5005 --dport 10001:20000 -j ACCEPT

# Outbound calls not working

While the above setup works for me for **inbound calls**, it doesn't currently
work for **outbound calls**.

The hostname currently resolves to one of two IP addresses:

    $ dig +short jmp.cbcbc7.auth.bandwidth.com
    67.231.2.13
    216.82.238.135

If I pin it to the first one by putting the following in my `/etc/hosts` file:

    67.231.2.13 jmp.cbcbc7.auth.bandwidth.com

then I get a `486` error back from the server when I dial `1-555-456-4567`:

    <--- SIP read from UDP:67.231.2.13:5008 --->
    SIP/2.0 486 Busy Here

    Content-Length: 0

On the other hand, if I pin it to `216.82.238.135`, then I get a `600` error:

    <--- SIP read from UDP:216.82.238.135:5008 --->

If you have any idea what might be wrong here, or if you got outbound calls to
work on Bandwidth.com, please leave a comment!
