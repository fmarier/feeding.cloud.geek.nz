[JMP](https://jmp.chat/) offers VoIP calling via [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP), but it's also
possibly to use the VoIP using [SIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol).

The underlying VoIP calling functionality in JMP is provided by
[Bandwidth](https://www.bandwidth.com/), but their [old Asterisk
instructions](https://web.archive.org/web/20101226183140/http://www.bandwidth.com/wiki/article/Configuring_Asterisk_for_bandwidth.com)
didn't quite work for me. Here's how I set it up in my [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/) server.

# Get your SIP credentials

After signing up for JMP and setting it up in your favourite XMPP client,
send the following message to the `cheogram.com` gateway contact:

    reset sip account

In response, you will receive a message containing:

- a numerical username
- a password (e.g. three lowercase words separated by spaces)

# Add SIP account to your Asterisk config

First of all, I added the following near the top of my
`/etc/asterisk/sip.conf`:

    [general]
    register => username:three secret words@jmp.cbcbc7.auth.bandwidth.com:5008/username

Note the extra `/username` at the end here. Registration will succeed without it
and strangely incoming calls will work, but **outgoing calls won't work**
without it.

The other non-default options I have set in `[general]` are:

    context=public
    allowoverlap=no
    udpbindaddr=0.0.0.0
    tcpenable=yes
    tcpbindaddr=0.0.0.0
    tlsenable=yes
    transport=udp
    srvlookup=no
    vmexten=voicemail
    relaxdtmf=yes
    useragent=Asterisk PBX
    tlscertfile=/etc/asterisk/asterisk.cert
    tlsprivatekey=/etc/asterisk/asterisk.key
    tlscapath=/etc/ssl/certs/
    externhost=machinename.dyndns.org
    localnet=192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0

Note that you can have more than one `register` line in your config if you
use more than one SIP provider, but **you must register with the server
whether you want to receive incoming calls or not**.

Then I added a new blurb to the bottom of the same file:

    [jmp]
    type=peer
    host=mp.cbcbc7.auth.bandwidth.com
    port=5008
    secret=three secret words
    defaultuser=username
    context=from-jmp
    disallow=all
    allow=ulaw
    allow=g729
    insecure=port,invite
    canreinvite=no
    dtmfmode=rfc2833

and for reference, here's the blurb for my [Snom 300](https://service.snom.com/display/wiki/User+Manuals?preview=%2F48399335%2F48399359%2FUM_snom3xx_V2.2_en.pdf) SIP phone:

    [1001]
    ; Snom 300
    type=friend
    qualify=yes
    secret=password
    encryption=no
    context=full
    host=dynamic
    nat=no
    directmedia=no
    mailbox=1000@internal
    vmexten=707
    dtmfmode=rfc2833
    call-limit=2
    disallow=all
    allow=g722
    allow=ulaw

I checked that the registration was successful by running `asterisk -r` and
then typing:

    sip set debug on

before reloading the configuration using:

    reload

# Create Asterisk extensions to send and receive calls

Once I got registration to work, I hooked this up with my other extensions
so that I could send and receive calls using my JMP number.

In `/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf`, I added the following:

    [from-jmp]
    include => home
    exten => s,1,Goto(1000,1)

where `home` is the context which includes my local SIP devices and `1000`
is the extension I want to ring.

Then I added the following to enable calls to any destination within the
[North American Numbering Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan):

    [pstn-jmp]
    exten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,1,Set(CALLERID(all)=Francois Marier <username>)
    exten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,n,Dial(SIP/jmp/${EXTEN})
    exten => _1NXXNXXXXXX,n,Hangup()
    exten => _NXXNXXXXXX,1,Set(CALLERID(all)=Francois Marier <username>)
    exten => _NXXNXXXXXX,n,Dial(SIP/jmp/1${EXTEN})
    exten => _NXXNXXXXXX,n,Hangup()

Here `username` is my bwsip numerical username. When calls are placed, this gets
automatically swapped in by my real JMP phone number, but Bandwidth appears to
**require its users to use their username in there caller ID string**.

For reference, here's the rest of my dialplan in `/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf`:

    [general]
    static=yes
    writeprotect=no
    clearglobalvars=no
    
    [public]
    exten => _X.,1,Hangup(3)
    
    [sipdefault]
    exten => _X.,1,Hangup(3)
    
    [default]
    exten => _X.,1,Hangup(3)
    
    [internal]
    include => home
    
    [full]
    include => internal
    include => pstn-jmp
    exten => 707,1,VoiceMailMain(1000@internal)
    
    [home]
    ; Internal extensions
    exten => 1000,1,Dial(SIP/1001,20)
    exten => 1000,n,Goto(in1000-${DIALSTATUS},1)
    exten => 1000,n,Hangup
    exten => in1000-BUSY,1,VoiceMail(1000@internal,su)
    exten => in1000-BUSY,n,Hangup
    exten => in1000-CONGESTION,1,VoiceMail(1000@internal,su)
    exten => in1000-CONGESTION,n,Hangup
    exten => in1000-CHANUNAVAIL,1,VoiceMail(1000@internal,su)
    exten => in1000-CHANUNAVAIL,n,Hangup
    exten => in1000-NOANSWER,1,VoiceMail(1000@internal,su)
    exten => in1000-NOANSWER,n,Hangup
    exten => _in1000-.,1,Hangup(16)

# Firewall

Finally, I opened a few ports in my firewall by putting the following in
`/etc/network/iptables.up.rules`:

    # SIP and RTP on UDP (jmp.cbcbc7.auth.bandwidth.com)
    -A INPUT -s 67.231.2.13/32 -p udp --dport 5008 -j ACCEPT
