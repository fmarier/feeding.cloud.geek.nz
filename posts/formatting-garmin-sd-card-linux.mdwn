Some Garmin devices may pretend that they can format an SD card into the
format they expect, but in my experience, you can instead get stuck in a
loop in their user interface and never get the SD card recognized.

Here's what worked for me:

1. Plug the SD card onto the Linux computer using a USB adapter.
2. Find out the device name (e.g. `/dev/sdc` on my computer) using `dmesg`.
3. Start `fdisk /dev/sdc` as root.
4. Delete any partitions using the `d` command.
5. Create a new **DOS** partition table using the `o` command.
6. Create a new **primary** partition using the `n` command and accept all of the defaults.
7. Set the type of that partition to `W95 FAT32` (`0b`).
8. Save everything using the `w` command.

Now if I run `fdisk -l /dev/sdc`, I see the following:

    Disk /dev/sdc: 14.84 GiB, 15931539456 bytes, 31116288 sectors
    Disk model: Mass-Storage    
    Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    Disklabel type: dos
    Disk identifier: 0x7f2ef0ad
    
    Device     Boot Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
    /dev/sdc1        2048 31116287 31114240 14.8G  b W95 FAT32

and that appears to be recognized directly by my [Garmin DriveSmart
61](https://www.garmin.com/en-CA/p/551976/pn/010-01679-07/).
