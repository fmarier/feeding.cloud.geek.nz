Hi 

I'm using OMD 1.10 and did not find gearman-job-server, but this solved this problem for me:
renaming \"localhost\" for ::1 to \"localhost6\" in /etc/hosts

first try:

    $ nc -vz localhost 4730
    nc: connect to localhost port 4730 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
    Connection to localhost 4730 port [tcp/gearman] succeeded!

after renaming localhost:

    $ nc -vz localhost 4730
    Connection to localhost 4730 port [tcp/gearman] succeeded!

hth!

Regards,
Stefan
