Thank you for this great howto.

Is there anyway to establish an s2s connexion with a domain that does not have SRV record?
Some of my contact use gtalk with googleApps with their domain and does not have access to their DNS server.
Is their anyway to disable TLS with all domains that use google's server?

Thank you,
Regards.
Charlie
