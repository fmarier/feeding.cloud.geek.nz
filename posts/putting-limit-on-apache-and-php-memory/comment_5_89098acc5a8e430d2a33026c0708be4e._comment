At the company I work for, in cloud services, we use mod_perl with apache 1.3.37 as a backend (nginx as front-end server) for the application. The mod_perl processes can grow depending on the client's useage pattern, so we set a limit on the number of requests an instance can take before it is killed and a fresh one is generated.
