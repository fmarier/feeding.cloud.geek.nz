@Marek:  
yes sure, as soon as a process is in a cgroup (EVERY child or process it starts) also ends up in the same cgroup without any race possible (by the kernel).  
  
Thus even double fork or any other child which was ever started by apache is put into the same cgroup where you put your initscript in the beginning.  
e.g with echo $$ >/sys/fs/cgroup/apache  
  
on stop of apache you just do a  
kill -9 of all tasks in /sys/fs/cgroup/apache/tasks and there will _never_ be any dangling cgi or other processes.  
  
you can restrict cpu and memory but also devices easily.  
  
hint: the cgroup-bin is IMHO *completly* broken (and that by design), but thats another story.  
cgroups can also be used with simple mkdir/echo/rmdir/...  
  
seems my first answer got lost somehow...
