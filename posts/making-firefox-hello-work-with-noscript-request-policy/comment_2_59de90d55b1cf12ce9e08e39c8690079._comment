Fabian: As far as I know, both the [backend server](https://github.com/mozilla-services/loop-server) and the [client](http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/loop) are both free software. The client doesn't use any binary blobs other than the optional [OpenH264](https://github.com/cisco/openh264) (which is free software though patent-encumbered).

It also relies on STUN / TURN servers which may or may not be free software, I'm not sure. Probably best to ask the folks on `#loop` (`irc.mozilla.org`).
