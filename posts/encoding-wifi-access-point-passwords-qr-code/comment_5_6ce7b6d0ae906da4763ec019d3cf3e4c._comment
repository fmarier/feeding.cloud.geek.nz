**WIFI:T:WPA;S:mynetwork;P:mypass;;**

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Paramater</b></td>
<td><b>Example</b></td>
<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>T</td>
<td>WPA</td>
<td>Authentication type; can be WEP or WPA or WPA2-EAP, or nopass for no password. Or, omit for no password.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>S</td>
<td>mynetwork</td>
<td>Network SSID. Required. Enclose in double quotes if it is an ASCII name, but could be interpreted as hex (i.e. \"ABCD\")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>P</td>
<td>mypass</td>
<td>Password, ignored if T is nopass (in which case it may be omitted). Enclose in double quotes if it is an ASCII name, but could be interpreted as hex (i.e. \"ABCD\")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>H</td>
<td>true</td>
<td>Optional. True if the network SSID is hidden. Note this was mistakenly also used to specify phase 2 method in releases up to 4.7.8 / Barcode Scanner 3.4.0. If not a boolean, it will be interpreted as phase 2 method (see below) for backwards-compatibility</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E</td>
<td>TTLS</td>
<td>(WPA2-EAP only) EAP method, like TTLS or PWD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>anon</td>
<td>(WPA2-EAP only) Anonymous identity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I</td>
<td>myidentity</td>
<td>(WPA2-EAP only) Identity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PH2</td>
<td>MSCHAPV2</td>
<td>(WPA2-EAP only) Phase 2 method, like MSCHAPV2</td>
</tr>

Order of fields does not matter. Special characters \, ;, ,, \" and : should be escaped with a backslash (\). For example, if an SSID was literally \"foo;bar\baz\" (with double quotes part of the SSID name itself) then it would be encoded like: WIFI:S:\\"foo\;bar\\baz\\";;
