I recently got an error during a [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) renewal:

    Challenge failed for domain echo.fmarier.org
    Failed to renew certificate jabber-gw.fmarier.org with error: Some challenges have failed.
    The following renewals failed:
      /etc/letsencrypt/live/jabber-gw.fmarier.org/fullchain.pem (failure)
    1 renew failure(s), 0 parse failure(s)

due to the fact that I had removed the DNS entry for `echo.fmarier.org`.

I tried to find a way to remove that name from the certificate before
renewing it, but it seems like the only way to do it is to create a new
certificate without that alternative name.

First, I looked for the domains included in the certificate:

    $ certbot certificates
    ...
      Certificate Name: jabber-gw.fmarier.org
        Serial Number: 31485424904a33fb2ab43ab174b4b146512
        Key Type: RSA
        Domains: jabber-gw.fmarier.org echo.fmarier.org fmarier.org
        Expiry Date: 2022-01-04 05:28:57+00:00 (VALID: 29 days)
        Certificate Path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/jabber-gw.fmarier.org/fullchain.pem
        Private Key Path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/jabber-gw.fmarier.org/privkey.pem

Then, deleted the existing certificate:

    $ certbot delete jabber-gw.fmarier.org

and finally created a new certificate with all other names except for the
obsolete one:

    $ certbot certonly -d jabber-gw.fmarier.org -d fmarier.org --duplicate
