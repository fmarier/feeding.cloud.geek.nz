While upgrading [Libravatar](https://www.libravatar.org) to a more recent
version of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), I ran into a
mysterious 400 error.

In debug mode, my site was working fine, but with `DEBUG = False`, I would
only a page containing this error:

    Bad Request (400)

with no extra details in the web server logs.

# Turning on extra error logging

To see the full error message, I [configured logging to a
file](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/logging/#examples) by
adding this to `settings.py`:

```
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'file': {
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'class': 'logging.FileHandler',
            'filename': '/tmp/debug.log',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'django': {
            'handlers': ['file'],
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'propagate': True,
        },
    },
}
```

Then I got the following error message:

    Invalid HTTP_HOST header: 'www.example.com'. You may need to add u'www.example.com' to ALLOWED_HOSTS.

# Temporary hack

Sure enough, putting this in `settings.py` would make it work outside of debug mode:

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']

which means that there's a mismatch between the HTTP_HOST from Apache and
[the one that Django expects](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/security/#host-headers-virtual-hosting).

# Root cause

The underlying problem was that the
[Libravatar config file was missing the square brackets](https://git.launchpad.net/~libravatar/libravatar/commit/?id=a8c1002a39e7a1ef7d0ed7e5fb2ecf536ad4eede)
around the
[`ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts).

I had this:

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = 'www.example.com'

instead of:

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['www.example.com']
