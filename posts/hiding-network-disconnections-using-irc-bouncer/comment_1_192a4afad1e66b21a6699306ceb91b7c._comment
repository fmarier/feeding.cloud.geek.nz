Why don't you just use mosh to connect to an IRC session running in screen? What's the benefit of znc and a local client?

Also, I've looked at znc particularly for multi-client support. The idea would be that I have a main irssi session, but during certain times I'd like to tune in to just e.g. #debconf-team from my smartphone. Unfortunately, bouncers usually do all-or-nothing to all clients (meaning I can either subscribe to all channels or none from the smartphone, which will drain the battery like crazy) and while I am led to believe that znc actually supports slave accounts and can be used for this, it's very complex to set up.

Finally, when you have multiple clients working, then privmsgs sent from one don't show up on the other.

All this makes me stay with mosh for now. If only mosh existed for Androidâ€¦
