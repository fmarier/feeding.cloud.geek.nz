Just a note that this setup still works with Ubuntu 13.10:

If you have an encrypted home partition and an encrypted swap as described here, pm-hibernate will use uswsusp and you have a working hibernation with swap encryption. The Ubuntu community articles should be updated with this, it works very well.

(Side node: A more timely cryptsetup is probably: `sudo cryptsetup --cipher aes-xts-plain --key-size 256 --hash sha512 --use-random --verify-passphrase luksFormat /dev/sdXY`. XTS seems to be faster for many people - check with `cryptsetup benchmark` if you have cryptsetup >= 1.6.)
