If your writing out unencrypted memory dump to that file then that's bad news. In that memory will probably be the keys and such nessicary to decrypt your encrypted volumes.  
  
I think (never done it myself) a better method is to encrypt your entire harddrive first, use LVM on top of that then use a logical volume for swap. That way the lvm stuff gets decrypted first and the suspend wakeup script in your initrd should be able to access swap.  
  
Another method would be to encrypt swap then make sure that initrd prompts you for your swap password before the wake up scripts run.  
  
Shouldn't be very difficult to do either. Check out 'man initramfs-tools' for details.
