The list of [available wifi channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels)
is slightly different from country to country. To ensure access to the
right channels and transmit power settings, one needs to set the right
regulatory domain in the wifi stack.

# Linux

For most Linux-based computers, you can look and change the current
regulatory domain using these commands:

    iw reg get
    iw reg set CA

where *`CA`* is the [two-letter country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
when the device is located.

On Debian and Ubuntu, you can make this setting permanent by putting the
country code in `/etc/default/crda`.

Finally, to see the list of channels that are available in the current
config, use:

    iwlist wlan0 frequency

# OpenWRT

On [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/)-based routers (including derivatives like
[Gargoyle](https://www.gargoyle-router.com/)), looking and setting the
regulatory domain temporarily works the same way (i.e. the `iw` commands
above).

In order to persist your changes though, you need to use the
[uci](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless) command:

    uci set wireless.radio0.country=CA
    uci set wireless.radio1.country=CA
    uci commit wireless

where *`wireless.radio0`* and *`wireless.radio1`* are the wireless devices
specific to your router. You can look them up using:

    uci show wireless

To test that it worked, simply reboot the router and then look at the
selected regulatory domain:

    iw reg get

# Scanning the local wifi environment

Once your devices are set to the right country, you should scan the local
environment to pick the least congested wifi channel. You can use the
[Kismet spectools](https://kismetwireless.net/spectools/) (free software)
if you have the hardware, otherwise
[WifiAnalyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer)
(proprietary) is a good choice on Android (remember to manually set the
available channels in the settings).
