Thank you for the useful instructions. This page alone provided all the steps that helped me share my scanner on CentOS 7 to a Fedora client. I struggled with my scanner trying to print something, and I didn't realize it for the longest time, but once I canceled that job, it all works with the instructions here, even with selinux.
