i setup a network scanner here because it is also a printer and already connected, by USB, to a print server so that many people can print on it without having to worry about cabling.

yes, they need to move their feet to get actual paper in and out of there. crazy physics. but it beats fiddling with wires. :)

also i figured i would mention there is a similar [guide in the Debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/SaneOverNetwork) - which seems to have slightly better SEO, so it comes up first. Therefore, I have reworked it to include the excellent suggestions here that were missing there. See if you can improve it further! :)
