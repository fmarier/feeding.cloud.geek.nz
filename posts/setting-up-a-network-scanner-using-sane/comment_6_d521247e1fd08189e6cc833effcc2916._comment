i also wonder if we could get this simplified somehow. i don't mind configuring the server so much, but it's kind of painful to have to edit config files by hand on each client that needs to be configured...

can't Avahi take care of this for us, just like it does for CUPS and printing? i looked around for this feature but so far all I've found are bug reports saying that it doesn't work ([ubuntu LP#508866](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sane-backends/+bug/508866), [debian #743420](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=743420)). and indeed, with `SANE_DEBUG_NET=128 scanimage -L` says:

    [net] sane_get_devices: local_only = 0
    [net] sane_get_devices: finished (0 devices)
    [net] net_avahi_browse_callback: CACHE_EXHAUSTED
    [net] net_avahi_browse_callback: ALL_FOR_NOW
    
    No scanners were identified.

So I'm not sure what's going on, but clearly this is not working...
