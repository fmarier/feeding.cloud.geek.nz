This document is about how to use SANE to share a USB scanner over the network, and it seems to use some SANE-specific protocol. All the comments in the relative configuration files are written as if the remote scanner was an instance of SANE on a Linux machine.

In my case, the scanner has built-in network support, and I haven't found any evidence that SANE supports this use case. That's unfortunate, since CUPS supports the printer portion of that device without much difficulty. I can't get the scanner close enough to my PC for a USB connection, so it looks like the only way I'm scanning from this thing from Linux is if I put a Raspberry Pi next to it just so it can serve SANE to me.
