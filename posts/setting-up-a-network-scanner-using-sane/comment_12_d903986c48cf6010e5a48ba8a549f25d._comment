@Some Guy: there exist backends to make directly-network-attached scanners available to the sane ecosystem. Look for \"sane-escl\" (part of core Sane project, airprint/airscan protocol) and/or \"[sane-airscan](https://github.com/alexpevzner/sane-airscan) \" (3rd party open source, airprint/airscan + Microsoft WSD \"WEB Service for devices\" ).

Debian Wiki goes into more detail:
[SaneOverNetwork > escl protocol](https://wiki.debian.org/SaneOverNetwork#Scanning_with_the_eSCL_Protocol)
