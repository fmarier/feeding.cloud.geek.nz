The instructions in this blog are spot on: everything worked right away (well, except the FW rule, but this is a very minor issue) and I ended up doing some googling for the Windows SANE client and found SANEWinDS on source forge. Works standalone and from Open Office and I am happy camper.

Thanks a lot for putting together this concise instruction, it saves my users from moving files around from the scanner sharing machine!
