sane is supported on windows (Xsane for win32, SwingSane), but only as a network client. You can't plug a scanner into a windows machine with USB and use sane, but you can plug a scanner into a linux machine, run saned, and then connect sane on windows to that.

Why would you do this? HP Multifunction printers are notorious for not supporting the latest version of windows. HP will make a \"universal print driver\" and ignore the scanner. So anyone with an older device (something made for XP or Win9x) can't scan from windows normally. saned keeps these devices alive.
