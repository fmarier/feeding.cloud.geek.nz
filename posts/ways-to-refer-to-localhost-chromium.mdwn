The filter rules [preventing websites from portscanning the local
machine](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/9860) have recently
been tightened in Brave. It turns out there are a surprising number of ways
to refer to the local machine in Chromium.

## `localhost` and friends

`127.0.0.1` is the first address that comes to mind when thinking of the
local machine. `localhost` is typically aliased to that address (via
`/etc/hosts`), though that convention is not mandatory. The IPv6 equivalent
is `[::1]`.

- <http://localhost/>
- <http://foo.localhost/>
- <http://127.0.0.1/>
- <http://0177.0000.0000.0001/> (`127.0.0.1` in octal)
- <http://0x7F000001/> (`127.0.0.1` in hex)
- <http://2130706433/> (`127.0.0.1` in decimal)
- <http://[::ffff:127.0.0.1]/> (IPv4-mapped IPv6 address)
- <http://[::ffff:7f00:1]/> (alternate of IPv4-mapped IPv6 address)
- <http://[0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:7f00:0001]/> (fully-expanded IPv4-mapped IPv6 address)
- <http://[::1]/>
- <http://[0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001]/> (fully-expanded form of `[::1]`)

## `0.0.0.0`

`0.0.0.0` is not a routable address, but that's what's used to tell a
service to bind (listen) on all network interfaces. In Chromium, it resolves
to the local machine, just like `127.0.0.1`. The IPv6 equivalent is `[::]`.

- <http://0.0.0.0/>
- <http://0000.0000.0000.0000/> (`0.0.0.0` in octal)
- <http://0x00000000/>(`0.0.0.0` in hex)
- <http://0/> (`0.0.0.0` in decimal)
- <http://[::ffff:0.0.0.0]/> (IPv4-mapped IPv6 address)
- <http://[::ffff:0000:0000]/> (alternate form of IPv4-mapped IPv6 address)
- <http://[0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:0000:0000]/> (fully-expanded IPv4-mapped IPv6 address)
- <http://[::]/>
- <http://[0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000]/> (fully-expanded form of `[::]`)

## DNS-based

Of course, another way to encode these numerical URLs is to create `A` /
`AAAA` records for them under a domain you control. I've done this under my
personal domain:

- <http://t127.fmarier.org/> (`127.0.0.1`)
- <http://t1aaaa.fmarier.org/> (`[::1]`)
- <http://t0.fmarier.org/> (`0.0.0.0`)
- <http://t0aaaa.fmarier.org/> (`[::]`)
- <http://t127aaaam.fmarier.org/> (`[::ffff:7f00:1]`)
- <http://t0aaaam.fmarier.org/> (`[::ffff:0000:0000]`)

For these to work, you'll need to:

- Make sure you can connect to **IPv6-only hosts**, for example by
  connecting to an appropriate VPN if needed.
- Put `nameserver 8.8.8.8` in `/etc/resolv.conf` since you need a DNS server
  that will not filter these localhost domains. (For example,
  [Unbound](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) will do that
  if you use `private-address: 127.0.0.0/8` in the `server` config.)
- Go into `chrome://settings/security` and disable *Always use secure
  connections* to make sure the OS resolver is used.
- Turn off the `chrome://flags/#block-insecure-private-network-requests`
  flag since that security feature
  ([CORS-RFC1918](https://wicg.github.io/private-network-access/)) is
  designed to protect against these kinds of requests.

## `127.0.0.0/8` subnet

Technically, the entire `127.0.0.0/8` subnet can used to refer to the local
machine. However, it's not a reliable way to portscan a machine from a web
browser because it only catches the services that listen on all interfaces
(i.e. `0.0.0.0`).

For example, on my machine, if I `nmap 127.0.0.1`, I get:

    PORT     STATE SERVICE   VERSION
    22/tcp   open  ssh       OpenSSH 8.2p1
    25/tcp   open  smtp      Postfix smtpd

whereas if I `nmap 127.0.1.25`, I only get:

    PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
    22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1

That's because I've got the following in `/etc/postfix/main.cf`:

    inet_interfaces = loopback-only

which I assume is explicitly binding `127.0.0.1`.

Nevertheless, it would be good [to get that fixed in
Brave](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/20457) too.
