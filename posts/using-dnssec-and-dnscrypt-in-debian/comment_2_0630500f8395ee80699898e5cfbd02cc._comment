There is a reason why every ISP provides a recursor: latency. Every new connection that uses a name (unless cached locally with a caching resolver), every newly launched binary that connects somewhere needs to bear DNS latency. Not sure if dnscrypt-proxy caches but it doesn't seem that useful as general advise if it doesn't and everyone uses a proxy in Iceland.
