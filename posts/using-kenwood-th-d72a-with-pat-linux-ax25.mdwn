Here is how I managed to get my [Kenwood
TH-D72A](http://www.kenwood.com/usa/com/amateur/th-d72a/) radio working with
[Pat](http://getpat.io) on Linux using the built-in
[TNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_node_controller) and the
[AX.25](http://linuxdocs.org/HOWTOs/AX25-HOWTO.html) mode

# Installing Pat

First of all, download and install the [latest Pat
package](https://github.com/la5nta/pat/releases) from the GitHub project
page.

    dpkg -i pat_x.y.z_amd64.deb

Then, follow the [installation
instructions](https://github.com/la5nta/pat/wiki/AX25-Linux) for the AX.25
mode and install the necessary packages:

    apt install ax25-tools ax25-apps

along with the systemd script that comes with Pat:

    /usr/share/pat/ax25/install-systemd-ax25-unit.bash

# Configuration

Once the packages are installed, it's time to configure everything
correctly:

0. Plug the radio onto the computer using a mini-USB cable.
1. Power cycle the radio.
2. Enable TNC in `packet12` mode (**band A***).
3. Tune band A to [VECTOR
   channel](https://vectorradio.ca/ops/frequency-list/) 420
   (or [421](https://www.repeaterbook.com/repeaters/details.php?state_id=CA02&ID=3586)
   if you can't reach `VA7EOC` on simplex).
4. Put the following in `/etc/ax25/axports` (replacing `CALLSIGN` with your
   own callsign):

        wl2k    CALLSIGN    9600    128    4    Winlink

5. Set `HBAUD` to **`1200`** in `/etc/default/ax25` and make sure that the
   `DEV` variable is set to the correct `/dev/TTYUSBx` device (check the
   output of `dmesg` after turning on the radio).
6. Download and compile the [`tmd710_tncsetup`
   script](https://github.com/fmarier/tmd710_tncsetup/blob/master/tmd710_tncsetup.c)
   mentioned in a comment in `/etc/default/ax25`:

        gcc -o tmd710_tncsetup tmd710_tncsetup.c

7. Add the `tmd710_tncsetup` script in `/etc/default/ax25` and use these command
   line parameters (`-B 0` specifies band A, use `-B 1` for band B):

        tmd710_tncsetup -B 0 -S $DEV -b $HBAUD -s

8. Start ax25 driver:

        systemctl start ax25.service

# Connecting to a winlink gateway

To monitor what is being received and transmitted:

    axlisten -cart

Then create aliases like these in `~/.wl2k/config.json`:

    {
      "connect_aliases": {
        "ax25-VA7EOC": "ax25://wl2k/VA7EOC-10",
        "ax25-VE7LAN": "ax25://wl2k/VE7LAN-10"
      },
    }

and use them to connect to your preferred Winlink gateways by starting pat
using the following:

    pat http

and then opening the interface in a webbrowser: <http://localhost:8080/>

# Troubleshooting

If it doesn't look like ax25 can talk to the radio (i.e. the TX light
doesn't turn ON), then it's possible that the `tmd710_tncsetup` script isn't
being run at all, in which case the TNC isn't initialized correctly.

On the other hand, if you can see the radio transmitting but are not seeing
any **incoming packets** in `axlisten` then double check that the speed is
set correctly:

- `HBAUD` in `/etc/default/ax25` should be set to **1200**
- line speed in `/etc/ax25/axports` should be set to **9600**
- `SERIAL_SPEED` in `tmd710_tncsetup` should be set to **9600**
- radio displays `packet12` in the top-left corner, not `packet96`

If you can establish a connection, but it's very **unreliable**, make sure that
you have enabled software flow control (the `-s` option in
`tmd710_tncsetup`).

If you can't connect to `VA7EOC-10` on UHF, you could also try the VHF BCFM
repeater on Mt Seymour, [VE7LAN](http://www.bcfmca.bc.ca/lanvhf.php) (VECTOR
channel 65).
