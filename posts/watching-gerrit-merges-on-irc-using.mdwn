In order to get a notice on [IRC](irc://chat.freenode.net/%23mahara-commits) whenever someone merges a change in [Mahara](https://mahara.org/), we picked the [cia.vc](http://cia.vc/) service. This allows us to keep an eye on what is happening with the codebase.  
  
If you want to replicate our setup, start by [creating an account](https://cia.vc/account/register/) on cia.vc and then [add a new project](https://cia.vc/account/projects/add/) and an [IRC bot](https://cia.vc/account/bots/add/) to your account.  

### Registering an IRC channel for the commits

To avoid interrupting our [main developer channel](irc://chat.freenode.net/%23mahara-dev) with commit messages, I thought of creating a separate channel for it on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/):  


    /msg chanserv register #mahara-commits  
    /msg chanserv op #mahara-commits fmarier  
    /msg chanserv set #mahara-commits guard on  
    /msg chanserv set #mahara-commits topiclock on  
    /msg chanserv set #mahara-commits email dev@mahara.org  
    /msg chanserv set #mahara-commits url https://gitorious.org/mahara/mahara/commits  
    /msg chanserv set #mahara-commits secure on  
    /msg chanserv set #mahara-commits keeptopic on  
    /msg chanserv topic #mahara-commits Mahara project | https://mahara.org | Commit log from http://cia.vc/stats/project/Mahara


### Sending code updates to cia.vc

Since the place where we host our code, [Gitorious](https://gitorious.org/), doesn't support automatic notifications to cia.vc, we added a [merge hook](http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.1.6/config-hooks.html#change-merged) into our [code review system](https://reviews.mahara.org/) to let cia.vc know whenever a commit gets merged into our branch.  
  
You can take a look at the [custom hook script](http://gitorious.org/mahara/mahara-scripts/blobs/master/change-merged) we wrote for this (note that this script also [updates our bugtracker](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/2011/05/integrating-launchpad-and-gerrit-code.html) at the same time), but here are a few notes if you want to write your own [cia.vc client script](http://cia.vc/doc/clients/):

  * Client scripts can submit data via [email](http://cia.vc/clients/git/ciabot.bash) or [XMLRPC](http://cia.vc/clients/bzr/cia_bzr.py).
  * The data needs to be sent in an [XML document](http://cia-vc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cia/xml/schema.xsd).
  * Make sure your text nodes are trimmed and avoid CDATA sections.
  * Keep an eye on Freenode's [#commits](irc://chat.freenode.net/%23commits) while testing your script.
