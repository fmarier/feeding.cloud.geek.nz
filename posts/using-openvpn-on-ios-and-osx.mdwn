I have written instructions on how to connect to [your own OpenVPN
server](/posts/creating-a-linode-based-vpn-setup-using_openvpn_on_debian_or_ubuntu/)
using Network Manager as well as
[Android](/posts/using-openvpn-on-android-lollipop/).

Here is how to do it on iOS and OSX assuming you have followed my
instructions for the server setup.

# Generate new keys

From the easy-rsa directory you created while generating the server keys, create a new keypair for your phone:

    ./build-key iphone   # "iphone" as Name, no password

and for your laptop:

    ./build-key osx      # "osx" as Name, no password

# Using OpenVPN Connect on iOS

The app you need to install from the App Store is [OpenVPN
Connect](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openvpn-connect/id590379981).

Once it's installed, connect your phone to your computer and [transfer the
following files using iTunes](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH12318):

- `ca.crt`
- `iphone.crt`
- `iphone.key`
- `iphone.ovpn`
- `ta.key`

You should then be able to select it after launching the app. See the
[official FAQ](https://docs.openvpn.net/docs/openvpn-connect/openvpn-connect-ios-faq.html)
if you run into any problems.

`iphone.ovpn` is a configuration file that you need to supply since the
OpenVPN Connect app doesn't have a configuration interface. You can use [this
script](https://gist.github.com/trovao/18e428b5a758df24455b) to generate it
or write it from scratch [using this
template](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html#client).

On Linux, you can also create a configuration file using [Network Manager 1.2](https://blogs.gnome.org/lkundrak/2016/04/20/networkmanager-1-2-is-here/),
use the following command:

    nmcli connection export hafnarfjordur > iphone.ovpn

though that didn't quite work in my experience.

Here is the config I successfully used to connect to my server:

    client
    remote hafnarfjordur.fmarier.org 1194
    ca ca.crt
    cert iphone.crt
    key iphone.key
    cipher AES-256-GCM
    auth SHA512
    proto udp
    tls-remote server
    remote-cert-tls server
    ns-cert-type server
    tls-auth ta.key 1

# Using Viscosity on macOS

One of the possible OpenVPN clients you can use on macOS is
[Viscosity](https://www.sparklabs.com/viscosity/).

Here are the settings you'll need to change when setting up a new VPN
connection:

- **General**
   - Remote server: `hafnarfjordur.fmarier.org`
- **Authentication**
   - Type: SSL/TLS client
   - CA: `ca.crt`
   - Cert: `osx.crt`
   - Key: `osx.key`
   - Tls-Auth: `ta.key`
   - direction: 1
- **Options**
   - peer certificate: Require certificate was signed for server use
   - Compression: Off
- **Networking**
   - send all traffic on VPN
- **Advanced**
   - add the following extra OpenVPN configuration commands:

         cipher AES-256-GCM
         auth SHA512
