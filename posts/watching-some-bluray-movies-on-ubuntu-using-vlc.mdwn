While the Bluray [digital restrictions management](https://defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management)
system is a lot more crippling than [the one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Scramble_System) preventing users from watching
their legally purchased DVDs, it is possible to decode some Bluray discs on
Linux using [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/).

First of all, install the required packages as root:

    apt install vlc libaacs0 libbluray-bdj libbluray1
    mkdir /usr/share/libbluray/
    ln -s /usr/share/java/libbluray-0.5.0.jar /usr/share/libbluray/libbluray.jar

The last two lines are there to fix an error you might see on the console
when opening a Bluray disc with vlc:

    libbluray/bdj/bdj.c:249: libbluray.jar not found.
    libbluray/bdj/bdj.c:349: BD-J check: Failed to load libbluray.jar

and is apparently due to a [bug in libbluray](https://mailman.videolan.org/pipermail/libbluray-devel/2013-December/001262.html).

Then, as a user, you must install some [AACS decryption keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy).
The most interesting source at the moment seems to be
[labDV.com](http://www.labdv.com/aacs/):

    mkdir ~/.config/aacs
    cd ~/.config/aacs
    wget http://www.labdv.com/aacs/KEYDB.cfg

but it is still limited in the range of discs it can decode.
