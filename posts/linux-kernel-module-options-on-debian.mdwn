Linux kernel modules often have options that can be set. Here's how to make
use of them on Debian-based systems, using the `i915` Intel graphics driver
as an example.

To get the list of all available options:

    modinfo -p i915

To check the current value of a particular option:

    cat /sys/module/i915/parameters/enable_ppgtt

To give that option a value when the module is loaded, create a new
`/etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf` file and put the following in it:

    options i915 enable_ppgtt=0

and then re-generate the initial RAM disks:

    update-initramfs -u -k all

Alternatively, that option can be set at boot time on the kernel command
line by setting the following in `/etc/default/grub`:

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="i915.enable_ppgtt=0"

and then updating the grub config:

    update-grub2

[[!tag linux]] [[!tag debian]] [[!tag nzoss]] [[!tag ubuntu]]
