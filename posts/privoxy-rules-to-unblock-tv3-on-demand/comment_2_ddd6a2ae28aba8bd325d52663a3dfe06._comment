I don't think that Privoxy can route HTTP traffic to different places based on URLs.  
  
The main uses for it are to:  
- enhance privacy through the modification of cookies, rewriting referrers, etc.  
- block undesirable contents entirely  
- run Perl filters to clean up the "mostly desirable" content  
  
You usually run it by chaining it to a different proxy (either before or after that other one).
