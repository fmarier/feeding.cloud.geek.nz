I found that just adding "doubleclick.net/pfadx" to my whitelist was enough to allow tvnz, tv3 and others.  
  
So far, I've yet to encounter a pfadx-type link outside of sites that force you to watch an ad before playing the content that you actually came to see, so it doesn't seem to be opening the floodgates to doubleclick to flood you with unrequested video spam (at this time).
